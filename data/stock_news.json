(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks. Goldman Sachs raised its target price for Chinese stocks today. They estimate that AI adoption could significantly boost earnings growth and possibly bring in $200 billion of inflows. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough has led these tech stocks on a strong rally, reigniting investor interest and optimism in Chinese technologies and capabilities. The firm raised its 12-month target price for China's CSI300 to 4,700 from 4,600. It also raised its price target for MSCI China to 85 from 75. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Analysts Are Watching: Latest Ratings and News and Top 14 AI Stocks on Wall Street: News and Analyst Ratings The Chinese startup may be all the rage for Chinese stocks, but some countries are exercising caution all the same. In the latest news, South Korea's data protection authority has suspended new downloads of the Chinese AI app from DeepSeek. This is after DeepSeek acknowledged failing to take into account some of the agency's rules on protecting personal data. The Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) has notified that the app service will be resumed once improvements are made according to the country's privacy law. Even though DeepSeek's web service remains accessible in the country, new downloads of the app are restricted. Previously, the US Navy also instructed its members to avoid using artificial intelligence technology from China’s DeepSeek. According to the Navy, DeepSeek’s AI was not to be used “in any capacity” due to “potential security and ethical concerns associated with the model’s origin and usage”. In a similar move, Italy's data protection authority, the Garante, has also ordered DeepSeek to block its chatbot in the country. This is because it failed to address the regulator's concerns over its privacy policy. Notably, BBC reported that the the first member of a Western government to raise privacy concerns about DeepSeek has been Australia's science minister, Ed Husic. Husic has raised \"data and privacy management” concerns over DeepSeek. \"I would be very careful about that, these type of issues need to be weighed up carefully”. DeepSeek has failed to respond to requests for comment on these issues. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Story Continues Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Most Profitable Tech Stock to Buy Now? A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. On February 13, Bloomberg reported that the company is planning to launch a product on February 19. Chief Executive Tim Cook has described the product as the “newest member of the family”. Posting on X, Cook released a short animation of a metallic Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) logo along with the message, without releasing more details. One possible clue caught through Cook’s animation, which shows the shape of the home button disappearing, is that the new device will be the end of the home button. Bloomberg News further reported that the new model will also include Apple Intelligence and the A18 chip, which is currently featured in the iPhone 16. Moreover, the model will also be Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s first device with an in-house cellular modem chip. Overall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the high-flying AI stocks on news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

What Happened: Chinese authorities have made it more difficult for engineers and key manufacturing equipment to leave the country, reported the Financial Times, citing industry sources and ministry notices. Last month, Foxconn reported that its fourth-quarter earnings increased by 15.17% compared to the previous year and by 15.03% from the previous quarter, reaching a record NT$2,132.3 billion, or approximately $64.83 billion.

Earlier this month, Hon Hai reported a 3.16% year-over-year increase in January 2025 revenue and also upgraded its forecast for the first quarter. Analysts suggest that Beijing’s strategy mirrors the Western tech transfer restrictions it has criticized. The informal controls seem to target India, while projects in Southeast Asia and the Middle East remain largely unaffected, the report noted. China’s commerce ministry has also proposed new export restrictions on technologies related to lithium extraction and advanced battery materials. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Why It Matters: These restrictions are part of China's broader strategy to retain critical technologies, particularly in semiconductor and battery production, as it counters tariffs from the Donald Trump administration and trade disputes with the EU. Earlier this month, China announced new tariffs of up to 15% on certain U.S. imports in retaliation for a 10% levy imposed by the U.S. on Chinese goods. \"China is building up a large export control muscle and being quite deliberate in what they choose to control,\" senior analyst Antonia Hmaidi told the publication. \"Fundamentally it's about keeping China central to global supply chains,\" she said.

            "full_text": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other most profitable tech stocks to buy now. Profitability remains one of the most sought-after traits in the technology sector, yet it is also one of the most complex. It is shaped by a delicate balance of investment cycles, competition, and market perception. While topline growth often takes center stage—driving valuations and attracting top talent—sustained profitability becomes crucial as industries mature, competition peaks, and new investments become necessary for survival. In this ever-evolving landscape, technology companies have mastered the art of balancing revenue expansion with profit growth by diversifying their businesses, building vast customer ecosystems, and continuously enhancing product experiences. Looking ahead, earnings growth will take on an even greater role in determining valuations, particularly as the breakneck pace of growth begins to slow. Investors will increasingly focus on sustainable profitability rather than just rapid growth. In a January 2024 article, Rob Haworth, Senior Investment Strategy Director at U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasized that technology companies possess strong earnings growth potential, largely independent of traditional business cycles. He explained: “What is not clear yet is how companies investing in AI as a way to increase efficiencies or monetize services for end users will benefit from these advancements. We’re in a consolidation phase to figure out what revenue growth will be going forward. If AI helps boost productivity, that will support not only current rising stock valuations but individual prosperity as well.” Franklin Templeton’s 2025 Technology Outlook echoes this sentiment, predicting another year of strong growth in the sector. The report notes that the “Magnificent Seven”—a group of leading tech giants—delivered exceptional earnings in 2024, outpacing both the broader market and the tech industry itself. While these companies are expected to maintain strong momentum, The firm anticipates that the rest of the sector may start catching up in 2025. Tech investments are projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reshaping the profitability landscape. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and autonomous systems present both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Some companies will achieve sustainable profit margins through strategic pricing and ecosystem advantages, while others will struggle under the weight of fierce competition and heavy reinvestment costs. For investors and stakeholders, understanding these shifting dynamics is key to navigating the ever-changing tech sector. Story Continues Our Methodology To identify the 10 most profitable stocks, we conducted extensive research on U.S.-listed technology and tech-adjacent companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. Rather than relying solely on absolute net income, we refined our selection criteria by focusing on companies with both an operating margin and net profit margin exceeding 20%. This approach ensures that high-margin firms are not overshadowed by larger corporations with higher overall earnings. After applying these filters, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their trailing twelve-month net income, with the company reporting the highest net income securing the top position. Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AAPL) has an operating margin of 32% and a net profit margin of 24%. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s dedication to design, quality, and user experience has established it as a dominant player in the consumer electronics market. The company is increasingly focusing on services and software, which significantly contribute to its revenue. With a large, loyal customer base and an expanding ecosystem, Apple exhibits strong business momentum. The company’s services segment, which includes subscriptions and digital content, is expected to grow significantly, providing a steady revenue stream. As of December 2024, Apple’s installed base of active devices stood at an impressive 2.35 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported steady Q1 2025 results (FY ending September 2025), with sales growth of 4% year-over-year (YoY) which came in line with street expectations, and EPS coming in slightly ahead of expectations.

The company returned over $30 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $3.9 billion in dividends and $23.3 billion through repurchases of 100 million shares. Additionally, it plans to expand Apple Intelligence to new markets and languages in April 2025, which is expected to drive further adoption and enhance the user experience. On January 31, a Morgan Stanley analyst reaffirmed his Overweight rating and maintained a $275 price target for the shares. He predicts a strong launch for the iPhone SE 4, with an estimated 3 million units built in the first quarter of 2025 and a total of 15 million shipments throughout FY 2025. He attributes the anticipated success to the iPhone SE 4’s improved hardware, including a 6.1-inch AMOLED display and A18 Bionic chip, which he believes will support a starting price of $499.

Wedbush, however, hopes Apple's AI-driven developmentsalong with forthcoming iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 introductionswill assist to restore ground lost. Analyst Dan Ives sees Apple Intelligence as a main driver of iPhone upgrades, especially in areas where the technology has already been launched. China should have the AI capability by April or May. Wedbush projects that ultimately 25% of the world's population will access artificial intelligence via an Apple device. Apple is hoping to stimulate expansion in China by creating an ecosystem of AI-powered apps grounded on Apple Intelligence. The project is supposed to generate fresh income and propel customer improvements. With a 1% year-over-year drop in iPhone income for the past quarter$69.14 billionApple fell short of the $71.04 billion expectation. Greater China's revenue also fell to $18.51 billion. China still presents a hurdle for Apple, but Wedbush notes simpler year-over-year comparisons and expects development to start in the area from the June quarter forward. Based on the Alibaba AI alliance, Wedbush thinks Apple CEO Tim Cook has properly handled the company's strategy in China despite continuous geopolitical concerns between the U.S. and China.

Despite holding a record-high amount of uninvested cash, Buffett's firm continues to buy up shares and expand its stake in oil giant Occidental Petroleum (OXY). Portfolio Wealth Advisors president and chief investment officer Lee Munson joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss what Berkshire's buying of Occidental and the legendary investor's behavior signals for the wider market. \"A lot of this stems from a huge sale of Apple (AAPL) that [Buffett] did last year and he just has a bunch of cash and he's slow to get it to use,\" Munson says, adding, \"[Berkshire has] been on a buying spree with Occidental, and I think that that's something that is notable.\" \"I think that what it really says is that this is a momentum market. It's hard to find good value right now and I think that Buffett is waiting his time,\" the strategist says, noting, \"I don't think we should think just because there's a lot of cash it means the market is ready to fall, per se.\" Related Videos 02:34 Growing bearish sentiments is actually bullish?

            "full_text": "Meta's (META) stock fell throughout the day Tuesday, putting its 20-session winning streak on Wall Street at risk. Shares of the social media giant fell more than 3.8%. The positive streak stretches back to mid-January and continued through President Trump's inauguration, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended, and the company's earnings on Jan. 29. Meta's stock is up 17% over the last month and 22% year-to-date. The company's stock continued to rally even as Zuckerberg said Meta will spend upwards of $65 billion building on cap-ex related to AI data centers this year, a significant increase from $40 billion the company said it would spend in 2024. Zuckerberg says plans include constructing a data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, that will be so large it would cover a massive chunk of Manhattan. Meta's wins come as the rest of its Big Tech counterparts struggle in the early weeks of 2025. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are each down more than 2% on the year, while Tesla (TSLA) is off more than 12%. Amazon's (AMZN) stock is up more than 2% year-to-date, but off 2% over the last month. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD (META) Follow View Quote Details 706.66 - (-4.07%) As of 2:46:17 PM EST. Market Open. META GOOG MSFT Advanced Chart Meta has a few key elements going in its favor, chief among them a sense that the company's AI investments are paying off better than those of its Big Tech rivals like Google and Microsoft. “They've used [their AI investments] largely to drive their business where … other companies have been trying to be a little bit more all things to all people,” Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research told Yahoo Finance in an interview last week. Meta is pouring cash into technologies that help power its advertising business and keep users scrolling through their feeds. “Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone,” Zuckerberg explained during the company’s Q3 earnings call in October. And during Meta’s Q4 call, CFO Susan Li said 4 million advertisers are using the company’s generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago. All of that makes AI an easier sell for investors. Meta also got a boost from AI startup DeepSeek, which revealed its own open-source AI model it says can rival the best of what ChatGPT and other high-value Silicon Valley AI companies have to offer. The fact that DeepSeek offers its AI as open-source software seemed to validate Zuckerberg's decision to do that same with Meta's Llama models. Story Continues Analysts say the plan could mean a steady flow of revenue in the future if larger firms sign up to license the software.

            "full_text": "'Have Your Own Individual Credit Cards And Checking Accounts' Suze Orman's Advice On Keeping Finances Separate In Marriage When it comes to managing money in a marriage, financial expert Suze Orman strongly advises maintaining financial independence. In a recent episode of her \"Women & Money\" podcast, Orman responded to a listener named Benjamin, who asked about combining finances with his new spouse. Her response? Keep individual credit cards and checking accounts to avoid potential financial complications. Benjamin, a 35-year-old finance professional, and his partner, Taylor, an emergency room doctor, wanted guidance on handling shared expenses and whether they should open joint accounts. Orman's advice was straightforward: couples should contribute to expenses based on a percentage of their income, but they should not merge credit cards or checking accounts. Don't Miss: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now Orman emphasized that financial autonomy prevents complications in case of unexpected circumstances. She shared that she and her wife, KT, manage their finances separately except for certain jointly owned assets. This approach, she explained, allows each partner to retain financial responsibility and control over their own money. “I don’t have to worry about: Is she balancing her checkbook? Is she overdrawn? Is she not?” Orman said. “We’re both independent, responsible for our own accounts.” One of Orman's biggest concerns with joint accounts is the risk of financial mismanagement by one partner. If a spouse overspends on a joint credit card or drains a shared bank account, the other partner could be left in a difficult financial situation. If the relationship ends, separating finances can also become a legal and emotional challenge. Trending: ‘Which Bucket Do I Draw From First?’ Suze Orman Explains To 67-Year-Old The Best Order For Tapping Into Her Retirement Accounts Instead, Orman recommends that each spouse maintain control over their own money while contributing fairly to shared expenses. A percentage-based approach ensures that contributions align with each partner's income, preventing financial strain on the lower-earning spouse. This method allows couples to equitably share expenses while still maintaining financial security. While Orman advises against joint credit cards and checking accounts, she acknowledges that some assets—such as real estate and vehicles—may be shared. Owning property together can make sense, but it's crucial to establish clear financial agreements to avoid complications in the future. Story Continues For example, if one partner contributes more to a home purchase, having a written agreement in place ensures fairness if the relationship were to end. Orman stresses that transparency and open communication about financial expectations are essential for long-term success in managing shared assets. See Also: Bezos' Favorite Real Estate Platform Launches A Way To Ride The Ongoing Private Credit Boom In addition to discussing joint finances, Benjamin also asked whether he and his spouse should invest in term life insurance, given that they do not plan to have children. Orman noted that life insurance isn't just for those with dependents. Considering Taylor’s career as an ER doctor, she recommended purchasing a policy as a precaution. At age 35, a high-value term life insurance policy can be relatively inexpensive and provide financial protection in case of an unexpected loss. Even if a couple has no children, a policy can cover funeral expenses, outstanding debts, or provide financial stability for the surviving spouse. Orman's advice hones in on her belief that financial independence is important in a marriage. “We’re both independent, responsible for our own accounts that way in case it doesn’t work out,” she said. “I’m not saying that, but just in case, then it’s so much easier.” Marriage is both a personal and financial partnership, and Orman's advice underscores the importance of protecting individual financial stability. Keeping credit cards and checking accounts separate can help couples avoid financial disputes and maintain autonomy, while still contributing fairly to shared expenses. Whether newly married or years into a partnership, following Orman's guidance could help couples navigate their finances with confidence and security.

            "full_text": "February 28 Economic Boycott: What A One-Day Spending Freeze Means For Retailers Americans are pledging to halt discretionary spending for 24 hours on Feb. 28 in protest of major retailers scaling back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in response to President Donald Trump’s policies. The nationwide economic blackout, organized by The People’s Union USA, targets companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), urging participants to hold off spending in stores and online. The boycott comes as a reaction to Trump’s perceived war on DEI. His executive orders have cut federal DEI programs and threaten to freeze funds for non-compliant companies, leading to the closure of PBS’s DEI office and prompting corporations to dissolve their own initiatives. “If we disrupt the economy for just ONE day, it sends a powerful message,” The People’s Union USA said on its website. Don't Miss: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. While the immediate financial impact of a single-day boycott may be minimal, experts suggest that the real significance is in the message and potential for long-term behavioral shifts among consumers. Kevin Thompson, CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek, “If it evolves beyond a symbolic protest, it could create further disruptions, affecting not just these companies but the broader retail sector.” The February 28 blackout is part of a growing trend of consumer activism, with boycotts gaining traction as a means to influence corporate policies. In recent years, conservative-led campaigns have pressured companies like Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD)  and Target (NYSE:TGT) to rein in their DEI efforts, which points to the power of organized consumer action. Trending: Many don’t know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment — Here’s how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big move However, the current political climate has left corporations in a precarious position, facing criticism from both sides of the aisle. David Primo, a professor at the University of Rochester, attributes the dilemma to years of “haphazard policymaking” by companies on contentious issues. “Companies need to figure out what they will take positions on, what they won’t take positions on, and then stand firm,” he told USA Today. Story Continues The People’s Union USA, led by John Schwarz, aims to unite people beyond their differences and create a powerful voice for change. Schwarz told USA Today that he plans to expand the movement with monthly boycotts targeting the “biggest offenders within the system.” See Also: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?The impact from the February 28 economic blackout may be minimal, but its message is clear—consumers are increasingly willing to use their purchasing power to influence corporate policies and demand change.The success of the boycott could set the stage for future consumer-driven movements, challenging companies to align themselves in an increasingly polarized landscape.

(0:30) - How Much Should You Follow The 13-F Filings? (4:10) - Investing Lessons To Learn From Warren Buffett (27:45) - Episode Roundup: BRK.B, AAPL, COST, V, AXP Podcast@Zacks.com Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks. Almost a year ago, Wall Street learned that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) was selling lots of shares of its largest equity holding, Apple. Apple is one of the \"4 pillars\" of Berkshire Hathaway and a key component of the business. At the May 2024 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett said they were selling for tax reasons. But the selling of the shares continued. As of the third quarter of 2024, Berkshire had sold 100 million shares. It now owns just 300 million. Apple is now just 26.2% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio, down from around 50%. There are three important lessons value investors can learn from Buffett's sale of Apple shares. 1. Buy and hold forever is a myth 2. Don't fall in love with your stocks 3. You can't market time Valuations: Does It Matter? 1. Apple Inc. AAPL When Berkshire Hathaway bought Apple in the first quarter of 2016, it was cheap on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. It had a P/E under 15, which usually indicates a company is a value. But Apple is now trading with a forward P/E of 32.3%. And Apple has a PEG ratio, which measures the P/E divided by growth, of 2.4. A PEG ratio under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth. But Apple is more expensive. Will we ever really find out why Buffett decided to start selling Apple in 2024? 2. American Express Co. AXP American Express is now Berkshire Hathaway's second largest holding in its equity portfolio. It makes up 15.4% of the portfolio. Shares of American Express have been on a tear the last year, adding 47%. Yet American Express still has attractive valuations. It trades with a forward P/E of 20 and has a PEG ratio of 1.5. Is this a buying opportunity in American Express? 3. Visa Inc. V Story Continues Visa is also a holding in the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Buffett bought it in 2011 and has never sold, or bought, more shares even as valuations soared in 2020 and 2021. Visa traded over 40x during the pandemic. It was a small position originally, and remains so, even though the shares were up 27.8% over the last year. Yet, Visa is still trading with a forward P/E of 31. That is \"cheaper\" than Apple but it's too high to be considered a classic value stock. Should investors follow Berkshire Hathaway into Visa in 2025? 4. The Coca-Cola Co. KO Coca-Cola has been part of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio for decades. It remains one of the largest positions in the equity portfolio, at 10.8%. Shares of Coke are up 16.9% over the last year. It's not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.5. Coca-Cola also has a PEG ratio of 3.8. A PEG under 1.0 indicates growth and value. Is Coca-Cola still a buy in 2025?

            "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6111ff4a-1dcc-3fc2-a0e8-f9cd6cb34931/should-you-buy-apple-stock.html",
            "ticker": "AAPL",
            "full_text": "Something's cooking in Cupertino. I'm referring, of course, to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which is based in Cupertino, California. Apple CEO Tim Cook all but told investors to circle their calendars for Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025 in a recent social media post. The world's largest company by market cap is expected to make a big announcement on that date. Should you buy Apple stock hand over fist before Feb. 19? Adding to the Apple family Last week, Cook posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a key product launch was imminent. Unsurprisingly, he was cryptic about what the new product would be. What is the most likely candidate for Apple's \"newest member of the family?\" Probably the best bet is an updated version of the iPhone SE. It's the cheapest iPhone -- and the only one that still features a physical \"home\" button, and it's overdue for a refresh. There are other possibilities, though. Apple could be preparing to introduce a new MacBook Air. Additional alternatives include the next generation of AirTags, a new Apple-TV box, or a redesigned iPad Air Magic Keyboard. Maybe Apple will have multiple new product launches. However, Cook's tweet used the singular \"member,\" so it seems likely that the company will focus on only one product. Will the launch provide a big catalyst? New-product launches have sometimes caused Apple's share price to surge in the past, although the stock moves didn't always happen on the day of the announcement. For example, the company introduced the larger-screen iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch in September 2014. While Apple's share price didn't jump immediately, the stock rose by a double-digit percentage over the next two months. Will the new product announcement this week provide a big catalyst for Apple? There's no way to know for sure -- but probably not. For one thing, Apple appears to be only issuing a press release about this new product. If the company was rolling out a game changer, it would almost certainly hold a major event to build the excitement. If the new member of the Apple family is indeed an updated version of iPhone SE, investors' reactions will likely be a yawn. The entry-level smartphone doesn't rank among the top sellers in the iPhone lineup. Story Continues Should you scramble to buy Apple stock? Back to our original question: Should you scramble to buy Apple stock before Feb. 19? The answer is an easy one: No. There's no reason, at this point, to think that Apple's new product launch this week will move the needle much for the company or the stock. However, whether or not you should buy Apple stock in the near term (but not necessarily before Wednesday's news) is a different question, and I don't think this question is easy to answer. There are three main knocks against investing in Apple. First, the company's growth has slowed considerably. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Apple's revenue increased by only 4% year over year and its earnings per share jumped 10%. That's a respectable level of growth, but not impressive by any stretch. Second, Apple's recent new product launches have been disappointing. The Vision Pro mixed-reality device, while highly innovative, is arguably the company's biggest dud from a commercialization standpoint in a long time. The generative AI capabilities released so far in Apple Intelligence have also been underwhelming to many users. Third, Apple's shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 33. This premium doesn't seem to be justified by the company's growth. On the other hand, Apple's iPhone-centered ecosystem remains strong, and its customer base is loyal. The company could have tremendous growth potential if and when it rolls out rumored new products such as a folding iPhone and smart glasses. I don't think Apple is a no-brainer stock to buy hand over fist right now. However, I wouldn't sell it, either. My view is that Apple is a great stock to keep on a watch list. Although I don't expect this week's new-product announcement to be a big deal, I predict the company will sooner or later announce a new product that is. Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now? Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

            "full_text": "Millions Of Americans Could Get Up To $1,000 A Year Under New Retirement Match Program A new federal retirement savings program could boost wealth by up to 12% for eligible Americans, with single women and minorities standing to gain the most, according to a Morningstar report last month. The Saver’s Match program, launching in 2027, will replace the current Saver’s Credit and could benefit 21.9 million Americans, the Employee Benefits Research Institute reports. The program offers up to $1,000 in annual federal matching contributions for retirement savings. Single taxpayers earning up to $20,000 annually, or joint filers making up to $40,000, can receive a 50% match on retirement contributions up to $2,000. Reduced benefits extend to single filers earning between $20,000 and $35,000. Don't Miss: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you. The program particularly benefits single women, who could see retirement wealth increases of up to 13.13%, according to Morningstar. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic Americans could experience gains of 14.57% and 12.10% respectively. “It’s a great tool to help incentivize savings and build on the principles of behavioral finance,” Spencer Look, associate director of retirement studies at Morningstar Retirement, told CNBC. “Even if people only qualify for a partial match, this is free money to get from the government for retirement.” The new program improves upon the current Saver’s Credit, which only 5.7% of taxpayers claimed in 2021, according to Internal Revenue Service data. Unlike its predecessor, the Saver’s Match doesn’t require tax liability to claim benefits. Trending: If You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now Workers in industries prone to retirement income shortfalls, including agriculture and retail, are projected to see larger wealth increases compared to other sectors. The program deposits matching funds directly into qualified retirement accounts. Successful implementation will require coordinated promotion between the Treasury Department and retirement plan sponsors to reach eligible participants, Morningstar researchers said. The long-term impact of the matching contributions could be substantial. A 22-year-old investing $2,000 annually with an 8% return could accumulate roughly $835,000 by retirement at age 67. Adding the maximum $1,000 match would increase the annual contribution to $3,000, potentially growing the retirement savings to $1.25 million. Story Continues “Seemingly small amounts of money may not feel like they’ll make a huge difference. But they do when they can compound and add up over time,” Look told CNBC.

            "full_text": "Nvidia shares moved higher in early Tuesday trading and look set to return to levels reached prior to the emergence of China-based DeepSeek in late January, as investors picked through details of the latest tweaks in its nascent tech portfolio. Nvidia  (NVDA)  which holds the market's dominant position in AI chipmaking making under CEO Jensen Huang, also runs a small portfolio of investments that, under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, require quarterly public updates normally reserved for hedge funds and large investment vehicles. In the group's latest 13-F filing, published on the SEC website Friday, Nvidia noted a big change in its stake in Arm Holdings, the U.K.-based chip designer it attempted to buy outright for $40 billion in 2020. Nvidia owned around 1.1 million shares in the group at the end of last year, its 13-F filing indicated, a 44% reduction from its prior report at the end of the third quarter of last year. The current value of its holding was pegged at around $181 million. The emergence of China-based DeepSeek, an cut-pried AI chatbot, triggered a record $593 billion plunge in Nvidia shares last month. Bloomberg/Getty Images Nvidia called off its attempted purchase of Arm three years ago, citing pressure from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as in China, over the impact of the deal on global competition. “Arm has a bright future, and we’ll continue to support them as a proud licensee for decades to come,” Huang said at the time. “Arm is at the center of the important dynamics in computing. Though we won’t be one company, we will partner closely with Arm.\" The latest move, however, could reflect Arm's reported interest in expanding its business, which at present centers around licensing intellectual property for chip designs, to a more proactive approach that could involve designing and selling its own line of processors. Nvidia slashes Arm stake Reuters reported last week that Arm is accelerating that effort, aiming to compete directly against some of its own licensing customers, which include Nvidia, Apple  (AAPL) , and Qualcomm  (QCOM) . JPMorgan analyst Harland Sur, in a note published last week, said that the planned investment by Arm's biggest shareholder, Japan-based SoftBank, in the U.S. AI venture Stargate could eventually lead it into direct competition with Nvidia. Related: An AI giant poses a new threat to Nvidia The analyst noted, however, that Broadcom  (AVGO)  is likely to be the biggest beneficiary, given its market leadership in custom AI chips, a lower-priced and highly efficient alternative to Nvidia's powerhouse GPUs. “With the stepped-up focus on compute efficiency (thanks to DeepSeek), we can see these AI ASIC programs being accelerated to further augment compute efficiency and drive a more aggressive cost/compute curve,\" Harland wrote. Story Continues Nvidia also unveiled a new 1.7 million share stake in China-based WeRide, a client that uses the chipmaker's software and lower-end GPUs to power its autonomous vehicles. Nebius Group, an AI-focused tech group rebranded from Russia's Yandex, was also listed as a new Nvidia investment with a 1.2 million share stake value at around $33 million. Shares of the Amsterdam-based group trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol NBIS. Sound Cloud, Serve Robotics out Interestingly, Nvidia also closed out prior holdings in SoundCloud  (SOUN) , which it unveiled in its maiden 13-F filing last year, and Redwood, Calif.-based robot delivery group Serve Robotics. Nvidia will post its fourth-quarter earnings after the close of trading on February 26, with analysts looking for overall revenues to rise around 66% to $24.5 billion and net income surging 62% to $20.85 billion.

            "full_text": "Source: TradingView.com Key Takeaways Constellation Brands shares traded sharply higher in premarket trading Tuesday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new investment in the beer and spirits maker. The stock looks set to break out above the upper trendline of a falling wedge pattern in Tuesday’s trading session, possibly paving the way for upside reversal. Investors should track key overhead Fibonacci levels on the Constellation Brands chart around $187, $204, $218 and $231, while also watching an important support level near $160. Constellation Brands (STZ) shares jumped in premarket trading Tuesday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) disclosed a new investment in the beer and spirits maker. According to a Form 13-F regulatory filing released on Friday, the Omaha-based conglomerate purchased 5.6 million shares of Constellation Brands in the fourth quarter, with the stake having a market value of $1.24 billion as of Dec. 31 last year. Some of the alcoholic beverage producer’s better-known wine brands include Meiomi, Robert Mondavi and Kim Crawford, while its Modelo Especial lager surpassed Bud Light in 2023 as the top selling beer in the U.S. Constellation Brands shares were down 26% since the start of the year through Friday’s close amid softening consumer demand and concerns that potential tariffs on Mexican goods could force the company to raise prices. The stock was up nearly 7% at $174 in recent premarket trading. Below, we break down the technicals on the Constellation Brands chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Falling Wedge Breakout Since the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed below the 200-day MA to flash a death cross in August last year, Constellation Brands shares have trended sharply lower, with the price more recently forming a falling wedge chart pattern. While the relative strength index (RSI) signals bearish price momentum with a reading below the 30 threshold, the indicator also points to oversold conditions, increasing the likelihood of a potential bounce. Indeed, the stock looks set to break out above the pattern's upper trendline in Tuesday’s trading session, potentially paving the way for an upside reversal. Let’s apply the Fibonacci retracement tool from the stock’s April 2024 high to February 2025 low, helping us locate several key overhead areas where the shares could run into selling pressure. We’ll also identify a key support level worth watching. Key Overhead Fibonacci Levels to Track The first overhead area to watch sits at the 23.6% Fib level around $187. This location on the chart may also provide resistance near the upper range of a brief consolidation period last month that formed within the falling wedge pattern. Story Continues Buying above this level could propel a move up to the 38.2% Fib level near $204, an area on the chart that additionally finds a confluence of resistance from the downward sloping 50-day MA and the prominent January gap’s opening price. Further upside may fuel a move up to around $218 near the closely watched 50% Fib level. Investors could view this area on the chart as a profit-taking region near a period of early-January consolidation that preceded last month’s gap lower. A longer-term share price recovery opens the door for a rally up to the 61.8% Fib level around $231. Investors may look for exit points near a crucial horizontal line sitting just above this area that connects a range of comparable trading action on the chart from November 2023 to December last year. Important Support Level Worth Watching Finally, during sell-offs, investors should keep a close eye on the $160 level. Bargain hunters may seek buying opportunities near this month’s low, which also marks the bottom of the falling wedge pattern and the stock’s lowest trading level since May 2020.

            "full_text": "Trump's Executive Order On Corruption: What It Means For U.S. Companies President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday directing newly installed Attorney General Pamela Bondi to halt new Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigations and enforcement actions for 180 days. The order also calls for a review of existing FCPA matters to “restore proper bounds” on enforcement. During a six-month period, Bondi is tasked with reviewing current policies and guidelines governing the Department of Justice’s approach to FCPA enforcement. The goal, according to the executive order, is to issue updated policies that “prioritize American interests, American economic competitiveness with respect to other nations, and the efficient use of Federal law enforcement resources,\" according to Trump's order.

BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. The FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from offering or paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, has been a target of criticism by Trump for over a decade. However, enforcement of the law remained stable during his first administration, with no significant changes in approach or the number of resolved actions. The executive order comes after New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on charges that he allegedly accepted bribes from a Turkish official, including free flights and discounted hotel stays. The DOJ moved to dismiss the indictment against Adams on the same day Trump signed the order, citing political matters rather than the merits of the evidence.

Some view it as a transparent use of prosecutorial power by the Trump administration to turn Adams into an ally, Jacob Eisler, a professor at Florida State University, told The Economist. The implications of the executive order for U.S. companies remain unclear. While the Securities and Exchange Commission shares jurisdiction with the DOJ over FCPA violations involving publicly traded companies, it is likely that the administration’s priorities will also apply to other enforcing bodies. Despite the temporary halt in FCPA enforcement, global law firm Morgan Lewis said companies should still prioritize compliance with anti-corruption laws, as the risk of future enforcement remains. Story Continues Statutes of limitations for FCPA violations extend beyond a single administration’s tenure, and companies may have related obligations under separate U.S. regulatory regimes, like those applicable to government contractors.

Green emphasizes that while Big Tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) will likely dominate due to their massive investments, older companies such as Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM) could emerge as AI winners. However, he cautions that the rapid pace of investment could lead to overbuilding. \"People tend to overestimate technological change in the near term, but they always tend to underestimate it in the long term.

            "full_text": "Meta's (META) stock fell throughout the day Tuesday, putting its 20-session winning streak on Wall Street at risk. Shares of the social media giant fell more than 3.8%. The positive streak stretches back to mid-January and continued through President Trump's inauguration, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended, and the company's earnings on Jan. 29. Meta's stock is up 17% over the last month and 22% year-to-date. The company's stock continued to rally even as Zuckerberg said Meta will spend upwards of $65 billion building on cap-ex related to AI data centers this year, a significant increase from $40 billion the company said it would spend in 2024. Zuckerberg says plans include constructing a data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, that will be so large it would cover a massive chunk of Manhattan. Meta's wins come as the rest of its Big Tech counterparts struggle in the early weeks of 2025. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are each down more than 2% on the year, while Tesla (TSLA) is off more than 12%. Amazon's (AMZN) stock is up more than 2% year-to-date, but off 2% over the last month. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD (META) Follow View Quote Details 706.96 - (-4.03%) As of 2:46:48 PM EST. Market Open. META GOOG MSFT Advanced Chart Meta has a few key elements going in its favor, chief among them a sense that the company's AI investments are paying off better than those of its Big Tech rivals like Google and Microsoft. “They've used [their AI investments] largely to drive their business where … other companies have been trying to be a little bit more all things to all people,” Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research told Yahoo Finance in an interview last week. Meta is pouring cash into technologies that help power its advertising business and keep users scrolling through their feeds. “Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone,” Zuckerberg explained during the company’s Q3 earnings call in October. And during Meta’s Q4 call, CFO Susan Li said 4 million advertisers are using the company’s generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago. All of that makes AI an easier sell for investors. Meta also got a boost from AI startup DeepSeek, which revealed its own open-source AI model it says can rival the best of what ChatGPT and other high-value Silicon Valley AI companies have to offer. The fact that DeepSeek offers its AI as open-source software seemed to validate Zuckerberg's decision to do that same with Meta's Llama models. Story Continues Analysts say the plan could mean a steady flow of revenue in the future if larger firms sign up to license the software.

            "full_text": "The rumor mill is spinning overtime on struggling Intel (INTC) as the tech icon looks at ways to create shareholder value. Chip rivals Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) are each eyeing deals with Intel that could break up the company, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. Broadcom is reportedly looking to gain control of Intel's lucrative chip design and marketing business. Taiwan Semiconductor is reportedly studying controlling some or all of Intel's chipmaking plants. A spokesperson for Intel didn't immediately return Yahoo Finance's request for comment. A breakup could extract a good bit of value for long-suffering Intel shareholders, Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis estimated. In an analysis of Intel's business, Lipacis said Intel is conservatively worth $167 billion or $38.24 a share. Intel's stock closed on Friday at $23.60, down roughly 50% over the past year. The stock has crashed 65% in the past five years to a market cap of $102 billion. Using more robust projections of financial performance for each business, Lipacis estimates Intel could be worth $237 billion or $54.18 a share. A path to a deal could be tough, Lipacis said. \"Depending on how a deal is structured, it might require regulatory approval from countries around the world, including China. Also, Intel has historically designed its factories to make x86 CPUs, so it is not clear if Intel's factories would be able to make external chips efficiently with its current physical plant. Finally, Intel's foundry business reported a 76% operating loss in 2024, vs Taiwan Semiconductor's 45% operating margin,\" he explained. Wall Street analysts at Raymond James, Bank of America, and Bernstein echoed concerns over regulatory hurdles and antitrust issues, with Bank of America’s Vivek Arya saying that \"any potential INTC split could be time-consuming and complicated.\" Plus, any deal involving TSMC and Intel's manufacturing business would face tight constraints given the rules of Intel's CHIPS Act funding, which requires Intel to retain ownership of more than 50% of its foundry, Arya wrote in a note to investors Tuesday morning. The Trump administration \"could be wary of a foreign entity completely taking over an iconic US-firm that has deep involvement with US Department of Defense customers,\" Arya wrote. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said in a note, \"[A] better outcome for [the] U.S. government would be to work with TSM separately to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint.\" Story Continues Intel was awarded $3 billion in US government funding in September to manufacture chips for the military. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Broadcom would be a good candidate to take over Intel's products business. \"Hock [Tan] has shown the ability to take a hatchet to costs, ruthlessly, while still preserving innovation,\" Rasgon wrote of Broadcom's CEO in a note Tuesday morning. Intel store at Promenade Street in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, 2025. (Ömer Sercan Karku/Anadolu via Getty Images) · Anadolu via Getty Images Intel has endured a challenging few months. The tech icon parted ways with embattled CEO Pat Gelsinger on Dec. 1. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). Intel named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as the interim co-CEOs. Holthaus was also named Intel Products CEO. Intel will likely fill the CEO role by bringing in a top name from outside the company, Wall Street sources have told Yahoo Finance since Gelsinger's departure. Any permanent CEO will have to repair trust with investors after missing financial targets and make a decision on the foundry business. It also requires immediately stabilizing the financials. That's in addition to likely exploring a breakup of the company to drive shareholder value. Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion. Net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year. Whatever happens to Intel, it will be important for the US. \"Well, it'd be great for the United States if their process, technology arm could be a credible alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. They're trying to do that, but that takes time and a lot of capital, so that is a very, very hard thing,\" Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).

            "ticker": "MSFT",
            "full_text": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other most profitable tech stocks to buy now. Profitability remains one of the most sought-after traits in the technology sector, yet it is also one of the most complex. It is shaped by a delicate balance of investment cycles, competition, and market perception. While topline growth often takes center stage—driving valuations and attracting top talent—sustained profitability becomes crucial as industries mature, competition peaks, and new investments become necessary for survival. In this ever-evolving landscape, technology companies have mastered the art of balancing revenue expansion with profit growth by diversifying their businesses, building vast customer ecosystems, and continuously enhancing product experiences. Looking ahead, earnings growth will take on an even greater role in determining valuations, particularly as the breakneck pace of growth begins to slow. Investors will increasingly focus on sustainable profitability rather than just rapid growth. In a January 2024 article, Rob Haworth, Senior Investment Strategy Director at U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasized that technology companies possess strong earnings growth potential, largely independent of traditional business cycles. He explained: “What is not clear yet is how companies investing in AI as a way to increase efficiencies or monetize services for end users will benefit from these advancements. We’re in a consolidation phase to figure out what revenue growth will be going forward. If AI helps boost productivity, that will support not only current rising stock valuations but individual prosperity as well.” Franklin Templeton’s 2025 Technology Outlook echoes this sentiment, predicting another year of strong growth in the sector. The report notes that the “Magnificent Seven”—a group of leading tech giants—delivered exceptional earnings in 2024, outpacing both the broader market and the tech industry itself. While these companies are expected to maintain strong momentum, The firm anticipates that the rest of the sector may start catching up in 2025. Tech investments are projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reshaping the profitability landscape. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and autonomous systems present both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Some companies will achieve sustainable profit margins through strategic pricing and ecosystem advantages, while others will struggle under the weight of fierce competition and heavy reinvestment costs. For investors and stakeholders, understanding these shifting dynamics is key to navigating the ever-changing tech sector. Story Continues Our Methodology To identify the 10 most profitable stocks, we conducted extensive research on U.S.-listed technology and tech-adjacent companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. Rather than relying solely on absolute net income, we refined our selection criteria by focusing on companies with both an operating margin and net profit margin exceeding 20%. This approach ensures that high-margin firms are not overshadowed by larger corporations with higher overall earnings. After applying these filters, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their trailing twelve-month net income, with the company reporting the highest net income securing the top position. Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) the Most Profitable Tech Stock to Buy Now? A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) TTM Net Income: $92.8 billion Number of hedge funds: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a giant in the tech industry, offering a broad array of software, services, devices, and solutions designed to empower individuals and organizations to achieve productivity and computing prowess. Its cloud computing platform, Azure, is a major player in the cloud services market, providing scalable and flexible solutions for businesses of all sizes. Additionally, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers products such as Microsoft 365, Windows, LinkedIn, Dynamics business solutions, server products, and gaming. Its operating margin stands at around 45% and net profit margin is at 35%. The company is currently focusing on integrating AI across its products to enhance data processing capabilities and operational efficiency, which should increase demand for its offerings. It has been aggressively expanding its cloud services, with Azure experiencing substantial growth driven by the rising demand for cloud computing and AI solutions. In its Q2 FY 2025 (FY ending June 2025) report on January 29, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported a total revenue growth of 12% year-over-year (YoY), with cloud revenue growing 21% and achieving a gross margin of 70%. Company CFO Amy Hood remains optimistic about AI-driven cloud services growth, stating: “Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect Q3 revenue growth to be between 31% and 32% in constant currency driven by strong demand for our portfolio of services. As we shared in October, the contribution from our AI services will grow from increased AI capacity coming online. In non-AI services, healthy growth continues, although we expect ongoing impact through H2 as we work to address the execution challenges noted earlier.” On January 30, RBC Capital Markets reiterated their Outperform rating on the shares with an unchanged $500 price target. The firm has recently released its software sector outlook 2025 where it favoured Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) for its diverse market exposure, large installed base, its position to capitalize on generative AI (GenAI) and its increased spending on technology development. Overall, MSFT ranks 3rd on our list of most profitable tech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

            "full_text": "Quantum computing is quickly becoming a popular investing theme. I don't blame people for wanting to get in on the ground floor of a promising tech trend, but many of the real-world uses of quantum computers are likely years away. But that doesn't mean a handful of quantum computing stocks aren't good investments right now. Here are two that could receive a big boost from artificial intelligence (AI) this year. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet has impressive AI and quantum computing chops Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) recently unveiled a new quantum computing processor called Willow, which drastically reduces computing errors and achieves a benchmark computation standard. The company said in a blog post that the new chip \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer,\" and Alphabet noted that Willow was made in the company's state-of-the-art fabrication facility in Santa Barbara, California, which is one of only a handful in the world. Willow could be a big step forward for Alphabet. The company has already mentioned that it thinks quantum computing will eventually help scale AI, expanding its uses. That may be years down the road, but in the interim, Alphabet is already seeing success with AI. Its Gemini chatbot is widely available to paying Google Workspace users, and the second iteration of Gemini will be a big step forward toward more agentic services. Specifically, the company envisions a hands-free AI assistant embedded in smart glasses and AI agents performing tasks for you like online shopping. After a few early missteps, Alphabet successfully integrated Gemini into its search, instantly bringing AI to millions of online search users. About three-quarters of Alphabet's revenue comes from advertising, and keeping Google users tied to online searches via helpful Gemini summaries should help Alphabet hold on to those ad dollars. A savvy AI leader with quantum computing services Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has already made big strides into AI, with an early investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The relationship between the two companies has evolved over the past couple of years, but it has given Microsoft access to the most advanced AI models and helped boost its position as a key cloud computing provider for AI. The company's latest results show how well Microsoft's early AI bet has paid off. Its artificial intelligence offerings have an annualized revenue run rate of $13 billion, a massive 175% increase. However, Microsoft isn't content with just integrating AI chatbots into its software and services; it's also taking big steps into quantum computing. One of the most significant is Azure Quantum Cloud, which gives customers access to quantum hardware and allows them to build and refine quantum algorithms. Story Continues Microsoft's Azure Quantum Cloud works with some of the leading quantum computing companies for hardware access, including IonQ, Quantinuum, and Quantum Circuits. With Microsoft already the second-largest cloud computing company (behind Amazon) with 20% of the market, its early moves into quantum services are a great first step to expanding its cloud opportunities as quantum computing demand increases. A firm AI foundation for the future Alphabet and Microsoft have already worked hard to achieve their current status in AI and quantum computing. Of course, there's plenty more work to be done, but as the need for more advanced AI services grows, the two companies should benefit from the foundation they've already laid. Both stocks look like good buys to me right now, but if I had to choose just one, I'd opt for Alphabet, considering its shares have a forward price-to-earnings of just 21. That's a steal, and currently cheaper than the forward P/E ratio of the S&P 500. Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this. On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves: Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $360,040!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $46,374!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $570,894!* Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

            "ticker": "MSFT",
            "full_text": "In this article, we will take a look into Microsoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with MSFT. As of 2025-02-18, Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $370.53. It's currently trading at a price of $408.43. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -10.23%. The company is fair valued. The model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Microsoft Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps. Assumptions Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $12.51 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.52%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 19.20% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation. Calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 189.06 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 181.47 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 370.53 Discounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $194.58. This valuation indicates that the Microsoft Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -109.9%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page. Story Continues The Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized. Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate. Navigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

            "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-amazon-com-amzn-185402909.html",
            "ticker": "AMZN",
            "full_text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks. With the first quarter of 2025 well underway, Jim Cramer hasn't been short of comments on artificial intelligence. AI stocks, which entered 2025 with optimism and tailwinds were dealt a shock during January's DeepSeek selloff. The selloff was centered around stocks of firms that investors believe stand to benefit from billions of dollars in AI GPU spending. The firm that led the DeepSeek selloff was the AI GPU stock that has been Wall Street's favorite. Its shares dropped by 17% during the day and are flat year to date after having gained 17% since the selloff. Cramer has also been one of the firm's biggest fans. For instance, consider his remarks made in January before the selloff. Cramer started out by bemoaning a lack of knowledge about the firm and shared: \"Okay, some of the analysts are good, but some of the analysts are just talking about the quarter! And these are people, who are, they are bound by the four walls of idiocy. This is one of the greatest companies in the world, these people want to buy sell, buy sell, they don't recognize that [the firm] is doing things that are just running circles around.\" In fact, Cramer went as far as to suggest that the firm was ushering in an industrial revolution. According to him: \"Industrial revolution, why can't we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn't get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\" However, the CNBC TV show host had to naturally adjust his expectations after investors re-calibrated their AI GPU spending. Appearing on Squawk on the Street the day after the selloff, he shared two factors that would be key in determining the future of AI stock performance. According to Cramer, these factors are energy spending and GPU orders. Investors have focused on energy stocks, particularly those that deal with nuclear energy -  a fact that has sent some stocks to gain as much as 140% over the past year. As for GPU orders, the Q4 2024 earnings season has seen big tech firms persist in their multi-billion dollar AI capital expenditure commitments. Story Continues In another morning appearance, Cramer also commented on an outfit he had discovered that was better than DeepSeek. He shared: “Now there’s an outfit that I’ve been dealing with called you dot com. . . .I really like you dot com. It’s one of those companies that is really ahead of DeepSeek, it’s way ahead.\" He added that after digging deeper, he found that the AI GPU firm mentioned above was actually this outfit's largest investor. The investment signaled to Cramer that there are alternatives better than DeepSeek as he commented that \"the long knives came out\" for it at the slightest hint of trouble. Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Is Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) the Best Major Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds? A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 286 Date of Cramer’s Comments: October 7th, 2024 Performance Since Then: 26.5% Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a key player in the eCommerce and cloud computing industries. Its cloud business offers the firm with AI exposure. Since Cramer's remarks, the shares have gained 26.5% primarily due to a strong third-quarter earnings report and analyst optimism about the firm's ability to generate revenue through artificial intelligence orders. Year-to-date, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s shares are up by 3.84% but dipped by 4% in February after its fourth-quarter earnings saw cloud revenue growth by 19% to $28.79 billion but missed analyst estimates of $28.87 billion. Here's what Cramer had said in September: “First downgrade, Amazon by Wells Fargo titled “Positive Revision Story on Pause Reducing to Equal Weight”. Totally get it, lots of headwinds, stock’s abused from the so-called bad quarter when Amazon fell from $184 to $161. Since then, it’s traded as high as $195, but it’s $186 as of last week. It’s time to sell? I’m not so sure.\" Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

            "full_text": "February 28 Economic Boycott: What A One-Day Spending Freeze Means For Retailers Americans are pledging to halt discretionary spending for 24 hours on Feb. 28 in protest of major retailers scaling back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in response to President Donald Trump’s policies. The nationwide economic blackout, organized by The People’s Union USA, targets companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), urging participants to hold off spending in stores and online. The boycott comes as a reaction to Trump’s perceived war on DEI. His executive orders have cut federal DEI programs and threaten to freeze funds for non-compliant companies, leading to the closure of PBS’s DEI office and prompting corporations to dissolve their own initiatives. “If we disrupt the economy for just ONE day, it sends a powerful message,” The People’s Union USA said on its website. Don't Miss: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. While the immediate financial impact of a single-day boycott may be minimal, experts suggest that the real significance is in the message and potential for long-term behavioral shifts among consumers. Kevin Thompson, CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek, “If it evolves beyond a symbolic protest, it could create further disruptions, affecting not just these companies but the broader retail sector.” The February 28 blackout is part of a growing trend of consumer activism, with boycotts gaining traction as a means to influence corporate policies. In recent years, conservative-led campaigns have pressured companies like Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD)  and Target (NYSE:TGT) to rein in their DEI efforts, which points to the power of organized consumer action. Trending: Many don’t know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment — Here’s how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big move However, the current political climate has left corporations in a precarious position, facing criticism from both sides of the aisle. David Primo, a professor at the University of Rochester, attributes the dilemma to years of “haphazard policymaking” by companies on contentious issues. “Companies need to figure out what they will take positions on, what they won’t take positions on, and then stand firm,” he told USA Today. Story Continues The People’s Union USA, led by John Schwarz, aims to unite people beyond their differences and create a powerful voice for change. Schwarz told USA Today that he plans to expand the movement with monthly boycotts targeting the “biggest offenders within the system.” See Also: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?The impact from the February 28 economic blackout may be minimal, but its message is clear—consumers are increasingly willing to use their purchasing power to influence corporate policies and demand change.The success of the boycott could set the stage for future consumer-driven movements, challenging companies to align themselves in an increasingly polarized landscape.

Musk touts that xAI's chatbot surpasses OpenAI and other competitors in multiple benchmarks. Lead Edge Capital founder Mitchell Green joins Catalysts to discuss the implications of these developments, noting that the AI race will intensify in the coming years. \"I think you're going to see over the next 6, 12, 18, 24 months lots of people continue to show that their models are faster and faster. As you saw in DeepSeek, you'll see that things get cheaper and cheaper,\" Green says. Green emphasizes that while Big Tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) will likely dominate due to their massive investments, older companies such as Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM) could emerge as AI winners. However, he cautions that the rapid pace of investment could lead to overbuilding. \"People tend to overestimate technological change in the near term, but they always tend to underestimate it in the long term. And, then of course, spending kind of goes the same way\" Green concludes.

            "full_text": "For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – February 18, 2025 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Amazon AMZN. Retail Earnings Loom: Can Walmart's Momentum Continue? Walmart shares have been standout performers this year, handily outperforming not just the broader market indexes and peers like Target but also the likes of Amazon and most of the Magnificent 7 group members. With the company on deck to report quarterly results on Thursday, February 20th, it will be interesting if the stock can maintain its performance momentum after the results. Walmart shares reacted favorably to each of the last four quarterly results, with the stock up more than +20% since the last release on November 19th. The chart below spotlights Walmart's impressive performance. The chart tracks the one-year performance of Walmart shares (up +84.9%) relative to the S&P 500 index (+22.6%), Amazon (+34.8%) and Target (-12.5%). Walmart will kick off the Q4 reporting cycle for the 'conventional' retailers this week, with the rest of the group coming out from the following week onwards. The Walmart report will set the tone for the rest of the retail space, as it will give us a good sense of the health of household finances and consumer spending trends. For example, one persistent spending trend in the post-Covid period has been consumers prioritizing spending on discretionary services like travel, leisure, dining out, and hospitality and spending far less on discretionary goods categories, including big-ticket items like appliances, furniture, etc. The very notable underperformance of Target shares in the first chart we shared is a direct result of this weak demand for discretionary merchandise, a product category to which Target is heavily exposed to. Unlike Target, Walmart has a much heavier indexing to groceries and other staple and must-have product categories that enjoy a relatively more stable demand backdrop through the economic cycle. Walmart's value orientation and well-executed digital strategy have been key to gaining grocery market share by attracting higher-income households. Walmart's growing share of higher-income grocery spending notwithstanding, the retailer still has substantial exposure to lower-income consumers who have been under a lot of financial stress due to the cumulative effects of inflation. Walmart has thus far been able to offset weakness from lower-income consumers by attracting more higher-income households through its efficient digital offerings. Story Continues Walmart's growing e-commerce isn't just a means to attract higher-income households, as it also opens up avenues for other higher-margin revenue streams like advertising and third-party fulfillment. Walmart is expected to report $0.64 in EPS on $179.3 billion in revenues, representing year-over-year changes of +6.7% and +3.4%, respectively. Trends in Walmart's non-grocery business have been anemic lately, though management had pointed to some early signs of stabilization in a few discretionary product categories at the last two earnings calls. Any signs of strengthening within discretionary merchandise will also have positive read-throughs for Target. With respect to the Retail sector 2024 Q4 earnings season scorecard, we now have results from 17 of the 33 retailers in the S&P 500 index. Regular readers know that Zacks has a dedicated stand-alone economic sector for the retail space, which is unlike the placement of the space in the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors in the Standard & Poor's standard industry classification. The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 17 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already belong mainly to the e-commerce and restaurant industries, though we have many restaurant companies on deck to report results this week as well. Total Q4 earnings for these 17 retailers that have reported are up +47.1% from the same period last year on +8.6% higher revenues, with 64.7% beating EPS estimates and only 70.6% beating revenue estimates. The EPS beats percentages for these online players and restaurant operators are tracking above what we had seen in the last two quarters for this same group of companies, but the Q4 EPS beats percentage of 64.7% is tracking below the 20-quarter average of 72.9% for this group of companies. The group's performance on the revenues side is a lot better, with the Q4 revenue beats percentage not only tracking above what we had seen in other recent periods but also above the historical average. With respect to the elevated earnings growth rate at this stage, we like to show the group's performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 17 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon's Q4 earnings were up +86.9% on +10.5% higher revenues, beating EPS and top-line expectations. As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now, with Amazon now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods and Walmart being a growing online vendor. As we noted in the context of discussing Walmart's coming results, the retailer is steadily becoming a big advertising player thanks to its growing digital business. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns. Earnings for the group outside of Amazon are essentially flat on a +6.3% top-line gain, which points to margin pressures for the group. Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard Through Friday, February 14th, we have seen Q4 results from 384 S&P 500 members, or 76.8% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +11.8% from the same period last year on +5.6% higher revenues, with 77.3% beating EPS estimates and 65.1% beating revenue estimates. Key Earnings Reports This Week We have almost 400 companies on deck to report results this week, including 43 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Walmart release, we have a number of the major Chinese Tech players on deck to report results this week, including Alibaba, Baidu, and Sohu.com. We also have many restaurant operators reporting results this week, including Cheesecake Factory, Shake Shack, Texas Roadhouse, and others. The Earnings Big Picture Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 companies, Q4 earnings for the rest of the S&P 500 index would be up +8.3% on +4.5% higher revenues.

There's been no clear transformational or canonical discovery in AI, yet,\" Offodile said. \"Lots of potential. Lots of stars being born and funded. With humility, we certainly don't want to overstate what we can accomplish, but I think we have maximized the odds of success by having these two enterprises thoughtfully engage,\" he said.

            "full_text": "Meta's (META) stock fell throughout the day Tuesday, putting its 20-session winning streak on Wall Street at risk. Shares of the social media giant fell more than 3.8%. The positive streak stretches back to mid-January and continued through President Trump's inauguration, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg attended, and the company's earnings on Jan. 29. Meta's stock is up 17% over the last month and 22% year-to-date. The company's stock continued to rally even as Zuckerberg said Meta will spend upwards of $65 billion building on cap-ex related to AI data centers this year, a significant increase from $40 billion the company said it would spend in 2024. Zuckerberg says plans include constructing a data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, that will be so large it would cover a massive chunk of Manhattan. Meta's wins come as the rest of its Big Tech counterparts struggle in the early weeks of 2025. Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) are each down more than 2% on the year, while Tesla (TSLA) is off more than 12%. Amazon's (AMZN) stock is up more than 2% year-to-date, but off 2% over the last month. NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD (META) Follow View Quote Details 706.68 - (-4.07%) As of 2:47:26 PM EST. Market Open. META GOOG MSFT Advanced Chart Meta has a few key elements going in its favor, chief among them a sense that the company's AI investments are paying off better than those of its Big Tech rivals like Google and Microsoft. “They've used [their AI investments] largely to drive their business where … other companies have been trying to be a little bit more all things to all people,” Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research told Yahoo Finance in an interview last week. Meta is pouring cash into technologies that help power its advertising business and keep users scrolling through their feeds. “Improvements to our AI-driven feed and video recommendations have led to an 8% increase in time spent on Facebook and a 6% increase on Instagram this year alone,” Zuckerberg explained during the company’s Q3 earnings call in October. And during Meta’s Q4 call, CFO Susan Li said 4 million advertisers are using the company’s generative AI tools to create ads, up from 1 million six months ago. All of that makes AI an easier sell for investors. Meta also got a boost from AI startup DeepSeek, which revealed its own open-source AI model it says can rival the best of what ChatGPT and other high-value Silicon Valley AI companies have to offer. The fact that DeepSeek offers its AI as open-source software seemed to validate Zuckerberg's decision to do that same with Meta's Llama models. Story Continues Analysts say the plan could mean a steady flow of revenue in the future if larger firms sign up to license the software.

            "full_text": "If we want to find a stock that could multiply over the long term, what are the underlying trends we should look for? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. With that in mind, we've noticed some promising trends at Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) so let's look a bit deeper. Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Amazon.com, this is the formula: Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) 0.15 = US$69b ÷ (US$625b - US$179b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024). Thus, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 15%. In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Multiline Retail industry average of 12% it's much better. See our latest analysis for Amazon.com NasdaqGS:AMZN Return on Capital Employed February 18th 2025 Above you can see how the current ROCE for Amazon.com compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Amazon.com . What Does the ROCE Trend For Amazon.com Tell Us? We like the trends that we're seeing from Amazon.com. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 15%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 224%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Amazon.com thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital. On a related note, the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets has decreased to 29%, which basically reduces it's funding from the likes of short-term creditors or suppliers. This tells us that Amazon.com has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with. The Bottom Line On Amazon.com's ROCE In summary, it's great to see that Amazon.com can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. Since the stock has returned a staggering 132% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Amazon.com can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead. Story Continues On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation for AMZN on our platform that is definitely worth checking out.

            "full_text": "Defiance ETFs launched a new ETF — Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ELON) – which seeks to capture the battle between innovation and tradition in the automotive industry. It offers unique investment opportunities and is the first of its kind. It pairs bullish bets on innovative companies with bearish ones on their traditional industry counterparts. ELON in Focus Battleshares TSLA vs. F ETF seeks long-term capital appreciation. It is designed to capitalize on the competitive dynamics within the automobile industry by taking targeted positions in two specific companies, one which the advisor views as a new leader in this industry —Tesla TSLA — and one which the advisor views as a legacy leader in this industry — Ford Motor F (read: Tesla Misses on Q4 Earnings, Vows to Return to Growth: ETFs to Buy).The new ETF employs a unique investment strategy by establishing a leveraged long position in Tesla, offering investors 200% of the stock's upside while simultaneously holding a short position in Ford, targeting around 100% of the fund's net assets. This means that ELON will benefit if TSLA’s share price outperforms F’s share price after considering the effects of leverage. The new ETF comes with a hefty expense ratio of 1.29%. How Will It Fit in a Portfolio? The ETF could be an intriguing choice for investors seeking exposure to the ongoing transformation within the automotive sector, aiming to benefit from the divergence between innovation and tradition. The ETF's long/short structure is particularly suited for investors who are bullish on Tesla's growth prospects and bearish on Ford's performance. This positioning allows potential gains from Tesla's upward momentum while hedging against potential declines in traditional automakers like Ford.However, it's essential to recognize that ELON's leveraged positions amplify both potential gains and losses, introducing a higher level of risk and volatility. Therefore, this ETF may be more appropriate for investors with a higher risk tolerance and a strong conviction in the underlying investment thesis. Additionally, due to its concentrated exposure, ELON should be considered as a complement to a well-diversified portfolio rather than a core holding (read: 5 Leveraged ETFs That Witnessed Double-Digit Gains in January). ETF Competition The concept of pairing long positions in innovative companies with short positions in their traditional counterparts is relatively novel in the ETF space. While there are existing leveraged single-stock ETFs that allow investors to bet on individual companies' stock movements, ELON is among the first to combine two different stocks with opposing directional bets within a single product. This innovative approach sets it apart from traditional ETFs that focus solely on long positions or broader market indices. Defiance ETFs has indicated plans to expand the Battleshares lineup with similar pairings, potentially including matchups like NVIDIA NVDA vs. Intel (INTC), Coinbase COIN vs. Wells Fargo (WFC) and Amazon AMZN vs. Macy's (M). These forthcoming ETFs aim to provide investors with opportunities to capitalize on competitive market dynamics across various industries. Story Continues Bottom Line The launch of ELON ETF offers a unique investment vehicle for those looking to engage in the evolving competition between disruptive innovators and established industry players.

Find the latest earnings estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar. Factors to Consider Walmart has been gaining from its sturdy comp sales, driven by its constant expansion efforts and splendid e-commerce performance. WMT has been strengthening its physical fleet, which plays a dual role of catering to customers directly and fulfilling a considerable chunk of the company’s e-commerce sales. Walmart has been focused on store remodeling in an attempt to upgrade them with advanced in-store and digital innovation. Additionally, the company has been undertaking several efforts to enhance merchandise assortments.WMT continues to be driven by its strong omnichannel business. From investing in pioneering data analytics to expanding its digital presence and optimizing in-store operations, Walmart leaves no stone unturned. Impressive store proximity to customers has allowed Walmart to use its stores to fulfill e-commerce orders. WMT has undertaken several initiatives to enhance e-commerce operations, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. The company is facing increasing competition from global e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN. Strong Earnings Estimate Revisions for WMT Stock For first-quarter fiscal 2025, the Zacks Consensus Estimate currently shows revenues of $179.18 billion, suggesting an improvement of 3.3% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) of $0.64, indicating an increase of 6.7% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings remained same over the last 60 days. WMT reported positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters with an average beat of 9.3%. At present, the Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year increase of 4.7% and 11.7%, respectively, for revenues and EPS in fiscal 2025 (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 30 days. Story Continues Even after this upward revision, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 (ending January 2026) revenues and EPS reflects an upside of 3.8% and 10.7%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2026 earnings has improved 0.4% over the last 60 days. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Future Catalysts Walmart has been innovating in the supply chain and adding capacity as well as building businesses such as Walmart GoLocal, Walmart Connect, Walmart Luminate, Walmart+ and Walmart Fulfillment Services. Other notable strides in the e-commerce realm include the buyout of a major stake in India’s Flipkart, which has been bolstering its International segment. Walmart’s majority stake in India’s digital transaction platform, PhonePe, is also worth mentioning. Additionally, WMT has made aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which has long been a major contributor to e-commerce sales. Walmart has significantly bolstered its delivery capabilities, as exemplified by its Express On-Demand Early Morning Delivery service, Spark Driver platform, partnership with Salesforce, the expansion of the InHome delivery service, investments in DroneUp, the Walmart+ membership program and a pilot with Cruise to test grocery delivery through self-driven all-electric cars. Preceding these endeavors, Walmart introduced Express Delivery in April 2021, and in January 2019, it forged partnerships with Point Pickup, Skipcart, AxleHire and Roadie. Additionally, the acquisition of Parcel in September 2017 was a strategic move to elevate its delivery service. Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investment Thesis Walmart has a return on equity of 21.78% compared with 12.15% of the industry and 16.94% of the S&P 500 Index. Walmart’s healthy cash flows have been allowing it to make shareholder-friendly moves. In the first nine months of 2024, it generated an operating cash flow of $22.9 billion and a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. Walmart repurchased 46 million shares for $3 billion in the first nine months of 2024 while making regular dividend payments. The company had $13.5 billion remaining under its share buyback plan. Its current dividend yield is 0.8%. Year to date, the stock priced has appreciated 15.2% compared with 3.9% of the S&P 500. Despite its overstretched valuation, WMT’s favorable Zacks Rank along with possible earnings beat, should drive its stock price in the near future.

            "full_text": "President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) comes from a background including safety leadership roles at UPS and Amazon—and has the Teamsters and one of its internal reform movements divided on what to think. The Teamsters applauded the nomination of David Keeling to join the Department of Labor, where he would serve as assistant secretary of labor to Lori Chavez-DeRemer. Both nominees still need to be confirmed for their positions. More from Sourcing Journal North Carolina Amazon Employees Vote Against Unionizing Wall Street Thinks Trump's Tough-On-Tariffs Stance Is Just Talk EU Commission, Consumers React to Trump's Tariff Promises “OSHA and the DOL, under the leadership of soon-to-be Secretary Chavez-DeRemer, will continue to benefit from leaders who started in the trades and understand the risks facing working Americans today and necessary reforms and opportunities to protect them,” the Teamsters said in a statement Friday. Teamsters for a Democratic Union (TDU), a grassroots rank-and-file movement of thousands of Teamsters members, did not share as glowing of an opinion as the wider union. “Teamsters know bosses rarely care about our safety. OSHA is already too weak and toothless,” the movement said. “Now more than ever, we need to fight for ourselves.” In the role, Keeling is expected to carry out OSHA’s mission to assure safe and healthy working conditions across U.S. workplaces and enforce whistleblower statutes and regulations. “I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to President Trump for nominating me to be the next OSHA administrator at the U.S. Department of Labor,” Keeling said in a statement posted on LinkedIn.” It is an incredible honor, and if confirmed, I am excited about the opportunity to work with Secretary Chavez-Deremer and Deputy Secretary Keith Sonderling to further OSHA’s mission to enhance workplace safety and health.” Keeling started his career as a part-time package handler at UPS before spending more than 20 years with the courier, most recently serving as vice president of global health and safety at the company until July 2021. From there, he hopped over to Amazon where he was the director of road and transportation safety for two years. Since June 2023, Keeling has worked as an independent environmental health and safety consultant. Both UPS and Amazon have had scuffles with OSHA in the past. In 2019, OSHA accused UPS of forcing its drivers to work in excessive heat with no air conditioning, a nugget TDU called out in its statement on the appointment. That same year, UPS was also cited for fire hazards at packaging facilities. Story Continues The delivery company capitulated in its new five-year deal with the Teamsters signed in 2023, introducing air conditioning in its brown delivery vans for the first time. UPS is still currently locked in a legal battle with the agency over efforts to install heat-stress monitoring devices in its trucks, with UPS saying OSHA lacks the authority to do heat-stress searches. Amazon reached a settlement with the agency in December to institute new ergonomic safety procedures at its facilities nationwide. OSHA had previously slapped Amazon with 10 citations, but agreed to withdraw nine of those claims after the e-commerce giant forked over $145,000 in fines. On top of the payout, the federal settlement requires Amazon to allow OSHA authorities to complete monitoring inspections at the warehouses where it initially cited the now-dropped hazards. New York still has a separate state OSHA investigation currently looking into Amazon, and whether the company has been working to hide its injury rates at its warehouses. The investigation overlapped with a Senate probe in December, which found that Amazon has been muddying injury rates at its warehouses to make them seem safer than they are. Amazon denied the findings in the report, pushing back at the investigation and rejecting results that it called “fundamentally flawed.” Nonprofit workplace safety advocate The National Safety Council welcomed Keeling’s nomination, calling him a friend of the council and highlighting that his real-world floor experience “will be a boon” to the government agency. Another nonprofit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group Public Citizen, wasn’t as impressed. “Unfortunately, being associated with corporations cited for frequent violations does not make Keeling qualified to run OSHA,” said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, in a statement. “Keeling’s work history with Amazon and UPS was marked by frequent citations for workplace safety and health violations.” Under Keeling, there’s a high chance protective regulations will be rolled back, in what has become a Trump administration trademark. As seen in areas such as climate and Big Tech deregulation and the recent cuts to the federal government by the Department of Government Efficiency, the new administration is expected to lean further into deregulation within OSHA. While OSHA’s first nationwide proposal to establish a heat-stress standard will likely be delayed, its final “walkaround” rule that allows OSHA inspectors to be accompanied by non-employee worker representatives may be withdrawn altogether. Business groups filed a lawsuit to block the latter, claiming it exceeded the agency’s authority. View Comments"

            "full_text": "North Carolinian Amazon workers voted “no” on unionization. Last week, employees at an Amazon warehouse in Garner, N.C., faced a vote on whether to unionize. Ultimately, the vote failed; the warehouse employs about 4,300 people, and just 829 of those employees voted in favor of the union. Meanwhile, 2,447 voted against it, and 77 ballots were cast aside because they had been challenged by Amazon or by the union. More from Sourcing Journal North Carolina Amazon Workers Vote on Fate of Unionization Exclusive: Here's How Amazon Haul Stacks Up Against Temu, Shein With Consumers Amazon Silent on Tariffs, Sets Aside $100B for AI Spending Spree That means the union, Carolina Amazonians United for Empowerment and Solidarity (CAUSE), received about 20 percent of the votes from employees; in order to unionize, more than half of workers would have needed to vote in favor. CAUSE, an independent union formed in 2022, has been fighting for more paid time off, longer lunch breaks and higher base pay for employees at the Garner warehouse, nicknamed RDU1. Specifically, they demanded a base wage of $30 an hour for all Tier 1 and Tier 2 associates. Today, employees receive wages that fall between $18.50 and $23.50, according to Amazon. Eileen Hards, a spokesperson for Amazon, previously told Sourcing Journal the company had hoped its employees would vote against unionizing because “Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting” and because “CAUSE has never negotiated a union contract anywhere and has no experience representing workers or their interests.” After the election, it became clear the e-commerce behemoth had gotten its wish. “We’re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,” Hards said in an emailed statement. “We look forward to continuing to make this a great place to work together, and to supporting our teammates as they build their futures with us.” In 2024, North Carolina had the lowest union membership rate in the country, coming in at 2.4 percent of workers, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nationally, union membership stood at about 6 percent in private companies last year. CAUSE said it would continue organizing but that it would need to “regroup and strategize beyond the legal structures that were never made to work for us,” according to NPR. CNBC reported that union organizers called the results a testament to Amazon’s “willingness to break the law.” Throughout the fight to organize, CAUSE accused Amazon of illegally interfering and forcing employees to attend anti-union meetings. Hards previously told Sourcing Journal such meetings were voluntary and said the company makes an effort to “talk openly, candidly and respectfully” to help its employees “make an informed decision” about unions. Story Continues “Amazon’s relentless and illegal efforts to intimidate us prove that this company is afraid of workers coming together to claim our power,” the group reportedly said in a statement to CNBC. “Amazon may think it is above the law, but we will not accept a system that allows billionaires and corporations to play by a different set of rules.” Amazon has historically been against unions in its facilities. In Alabama, officials found the company illegally impacted the results of a failed 2021 union election. The second election at the warehouse was a close race, compounded by accusations from each party that the other had broken applicable laws. Last year, a judge ruled that the union could run a third election—effectively to re-run the second election—in Alabama, and Amazon is currently appealing that decision. In Staten Island, N.Y., organizers who successfully convinced enough employees to vote in favor of unionization have faced an uphill battle in getting the company to come to the table to form a bargaining agreement. Amazon also owns Whole Foods; in January, a Philadelphia-based store voted to unionize. Whole Foods has since requested that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) disallow that union’s results, since, at the moment, the agency lacks a quorum to certify such a win. That’s due to the fact that President Donald Trump parted ways with one member of the NLRB after taking office, leaving just two members. CAUSE organizers indicated some worry over a similar issue, had they been able to persuade a majority of Garner workers to unionize. In Canada, Amazon is being accused of union-busting after shutting down a group of warehouses in Quebec. One of those warehouses had voted to unionize and was working on a collective bargaining agreement. That union, Confédération des syndicats nationaux (CSN), has committed to pursuing legal action against the company. View Comments"

Semiconductor manufacturers generate revenue from AI chips and infrastructure, while software companies must convert AI capabilities into sustainable revenue streams. Tech giants leverage AI to enhance existing profit centers, and emerging players seek to disrupt traditional industries. The AI market's rapid evolution favors companies with strong intellectual property, proven revenue models, and the resources to maintain competitive advantages. While market enthusiasm has driven up valuations across the AI space, selective investments in companies with clear paths to profitability and defensible market positions could handsomely reward patient investors.

            "full_text": "We recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against other most profitable tech stocks to buy now. Profitability remains one of the most sought-after traits in the technology sector, yet it is also one of the most complex. It is shaped by a delicate balance of investment cycles, competition, and market perception. While topline growth often takes center stage—driving valuations and attracting top talent—sustained profitability becomes crucial as industries mature, competition peaks, and new investments become necessary for survival. In this ever-evolving landscape, technology companies have mastered the art of balancing revenue expansion with profit growth by diversifying their businesses, building vast customer ecosystems, and continuously enhancing product experiences. Looking ahead, earnings growth will take on an even greater role in determining valuations, particularly as the breakneck pace of growth begins to slow. Investors will increasingly focus on sustainable profitability rather than just rapid growth. In a January 2024 article, Rob Haworth, Senior Investment Strategy Director at U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasized that technology companies possess strong earnings growth potential, largely independent of traditional business cycles. He explained: “What is not clear yet is how companies investing in AI as a way to increase efficiencies or monetize services for end users will benefit from these advancements. We’re in a consolidation phase to figure out what revenue growth will be going forward. If AI helps boost productivity, that will support not only current rising stock valuations but individual prosperity as well.” Franklin Templeton’s 2025 Technology Outlook echoes this sentiment, predicting another year of strong growth in the sector. The report notes that the “Magnificent Seven”—a group of leading tech giants—delivered exceptional earnings in 2024, outpacing both the broader market and the tech industry itself. While these companies are expected to maintain strong momentum, The firm anticipates that the rest of the sector may start catching up in 2025. Tech investments are projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reshaping the profitability landscape. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and autonomous systems present both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Some companies will achieve sustainable profit margins through strategic pricing and ecosystem advantages, while others will struggle under the weight of fierce competition and heavy reinvestment costs. For investors and stakeholders, understanding these shifting dynamics is key to navigating the ever-changing tech sector. Story Continues Our Methodology To identify the 10 most profitable stocks, we conducted extensive research on U.S.-listed technology and tech-adjacent companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. Rather than relying solely on absolute net income, we refined our selection criteria by focusing on companies with both an operating margin and net profit margin exceeding 20%. This approach ensures that high-margin firms are not overshadowed by larger corporations with higher overall earnings. After applying these filters, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their trailing twelve-month net income, with the company reporting the highest net income securing the top position. Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

            "full_text": "Ryan Serhant Closed The Biggest Deal Of His Career For $200 Million. This Is How The Celebrity Broker Elevated His Business Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. In a career that constantly seems to be scaling new heights, broker and reality T.V. star Ryan Serhant just hit a new one: “Sold and closed the most expensive home of my entire career today for just under $200M,” he wrote in a Instagram story on Feb. 4. If that wasn’t enough, the star of Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) \"Owning Manhattan\" secured the deal while giving new meaning to the mile-high club. “I did the deal over the phone. Wire hit while I was in the air to visit [Serhant Miami] to launch our sales center for Mercedes... Everyone was clapping, even the pilots. What. Is. Life,” the media-savvy broker enthused. Don't Miss: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate. Many don’t know there are tax benefits when buying a unit as an investment — Here’s how to invest in real estate by mirroring BlackRock's big move Swooping In To Steal The Deal The seller of the Miami deal was Estée Lauder (NYSE:EL) heir William Lauder, while the buyer’s identity has been under wraps. It marks a notable coup for Serhant—an out-of-town broker swooping in to land a coveted deal under local luxury brokerages’ noses. He’s made it a signature move, pulling off the same play in Delray Beach two years ago. He landed in Miami in February 4 to showcase the Mercedes-Benz Places Sales Gallery, giving prospective residents a preview of the branded luxury condo development before completion. According to a March 2024 newsletter, the waterfront property was designed by SHoP Architects and features nearly 800 homes across 67 stories. Shortly after the project was announced last year, Ryan and his team confirmed they had sold 100 units within four days. Trending: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.  A Dizzying Year Of Milestones It’s been a dizzying year of milestones for the former out-of-work actor and hand model who decided to trade careers, selling real estate instead of cell phones. The Netflix reality series \"Selling Manhattan\" was a game changer. “Traffic to our website increased by a couple hundred percent,” he told Realtor.com about the immediate impact of the show’s success. “We now get somewhere between 200 and 300 resumes a day from real estate agents who are asking to work here and owners of independent brokerages who would like to open up SERHANT offices in their territories. I mean, I could go on and on and on.” Story Continues Sales have boomed, too. \"The Huron, the new development in Greenpoint [Brooklyn] that we filmed where we had the buyer who bought one apartment but then asked to do four apartments at the building—we saw traffic spike by over 1,000% to that website, and we were booked fully with appointments to show that building into, like, middle of July,” he told Realtor.com. See Also: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. A Net Worth That Keeps Rising While multiple websites have put Serhant’s net worth to be about $40 million, it’s hard to put an exact number on his wealth because with each deal, his agents close his brokerage, and thus, he makes a commission. A 6% broker’s fee of $200 million is $12 million. If SERHANT nets 50% of that, it would be $6 million, from which he would need to pay agents and funnel some of the money back into the costs of running his business. Assuming his agents are doing multiple high-end deals daily, the commissions returning to the brokerage owner could be considerable. That doesn’t include the money he stands to make from Season 2 of \"Owning Manhattan,\" his rabid social media following, books, new AI platform, S.mple, live appearances, and his luxury Brooklyn Heights brownstone, which cost $7.6 million when he purchased it in 2018 before undergoing a $2.6 million renovation. Considering upscale townhomes in Brooklyn Heights are now selling for $15 million to $20 million, Serhant’s personal residence — even if he has a mortgage on it — was a savvy move, just like the rest of his career.

            "full_text": "In this article, we will take a look into Netflix Inc's (NASDAQ:NFLX) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow. As of 2025-02-18, Netflix Inc's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $619.69. It's currently trading at a price of $1058.6. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -70.83%. The company is modestly overvalued. The model The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. Netflix Inc's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps. Assumptions Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $19.83 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.52%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 53.30% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation. Calculation Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 1742.46 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 3560.38 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 619.69 Discounted Free Cash Flow Model GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $181.81. This valuation indicates that the Netflix Inc is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -482.26%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page. Story Continues The Bottom Line Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized. Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate. Navigating with GuruFocus: Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

            "full_text": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Streaming Service Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other streaming service stocks. The live streaming market size is expected to increase by US$20.64 billion, reflecting a CAGR of ~16.6% over 2024 and 2029, as per Technavio. The significant use of smartphones and constant internet connectivity allows users to easily stream content, resulting in market expansion. Furthermore, technological advancements such as AI and VR continue to enhance user experiences, further bolstering the market's momentum. Pivoting to Next-generation Streaming 2.0 After 4 years of experimentation among the legacy global diversified media companies, S&P Global believes that 2025 can be an inflection point in the broader industry's multi-year transition to streaming from linear TV. The scaling of advertising on streaming is expected to be a critical component for growth in profitability. Most of the streaming services don't have enough subscribers on ad-tiers to attract advertising dollars, mainly those advertising budgets that are departing linear TV, says the firm. Mainly for 2025, the firm expects companies to announce international JVs and domestic bundling arrangements. Why? These strategies can help the scaling up of streaming services, manage operating expenses through sharing infrastructure costs (mainly in second-tier international markets), and reduce churn.

Focusing on Quality and Not Quantity As per BDO, media companies and those organizations providing streaming services have increased their content libraries in a bid to attract new customers. Over the past few years, several media companies and streaming providers focused on customer attraction, targeting to get as many new subscribers as possible. The streaming platforms continued to churn out new material, resulting in a content boom. Now, the companies are focused on prioritizing customer retention as they reassess the quality of their content to ensure that it addresses demand. BDO expects that most major streaming platforms are expected to increase their spending on content by less than 10% over the upcoming few years. The broader streaming industry continues to invest in podcasts. However, since the podcast space remains crowded, differentiating new products is expected to remain critical in 2025 to fuel demand. Story Continues As the broader sector evolves, media companies and streaming platforms need to revamp their strategies to reap the benefits of opportunities and address challenges, like subscribers sharing credentials and customer retention. BDO opines that these companies are required to look for ways to improve revenues, either by increasing the service fees or adding ad-free tiers. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Streaming Service Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we sifted through several online rankings and chose companies catering to the broader streaming services sector. Next, we chose the ones that analysts view as Strong Buy stocks and see upside to. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 14. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Netflix, Inc. (NFLX): Jim Cramer Calls It “The Best of the Best” in Streaming A home theater with family members enjoying streaming content together. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Average Upside Potential: 4% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 121 Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) offers entertainment services. It provides television (TV) series, documentaries, feature films, and games throughout various genres and languages. The company has received a “Buy” rating from analyst Hamilton Faber at Redburn Atlantic, fueled by its advertising revenue. The analyst opines that the company possesses strong growth opportunities with its underutilized ad inventory as it strengthens its partnerships. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) gained 18.9 million new subscribers in Q4 2024, resulting in global paid memberships of 301.63 million, courtesy of the success of live sports events and some hit TV shows such as “Squid Game.” Elsewhere, Bernstein mentioned that the Tyson-Paul fight, which was the most-streamed sporting event, led to a significant surge in new subscribers. Bernstein opines that Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has cemented its position as a credible platform for live events, thereby unlocking strong growth in advertising revenues. Similarly, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) plans to stream more live sports this year. Also, the company has managed to secure exclusive US streaming rights for the 2027 and 2031 FIFA Women’s World Cup.

            "full_text": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. One way to prevent people from canceling a streaming subscription: go big on live events and sports. And that's what Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) are doing in their ongoing battle with struggling traditional TV players such as Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). \"It's [easier] to cancel streaming than it is a cable service. You push a button on the platform and you're out,\" Horizon Sports and Experiences co-CEO David Levy told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen in below). Levy has a longstanding career in cutting-edge television. In 1987, he was hired as one of the first 200 employees at Turner Broadcasting, where he spent 33 years and ended as the network's president. Preventing churn ultimately requires providing content that keeps customers around. Noting that Amazon streaming introduced Thursday Night Football, which ran on an 18-week schedule, Levy added, \"If you want to watch Thursday Night Football, you're not canceling your subscription.\" Netflix, a direct competitor, began offering WWE programming last month. That's on top of last November's fight between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul, which drew 64 million viewers. Netflix is now rumored to be eyeing rights deals for F1 and UFC. The NFL could opt out of its TV rights deal with everyone but Disney in 2028, which could attract interest from the big-spending streaming platforms. \"In order to continue to grow their sponsorship, they have to get into the sports business,\" said Levy. \"They are adding new subscribers because Wall Street is demanding that they continue to grow.\" Sports content also has a major advantage over its scripted and unscripted streaming service siblings. \"[With scripted programs] you don't know whether it's a success or not,\" he said. \"You know sports is going to be successful. They have built in fan bases.\" PWC recently estimated that by 2025, more than 90 million US viewers would stream a sports event at least once per month, a substantial increase from 2021's 57 million streaming viewership results. \"In the end, our view remains unchanged that Netflix has won the global streaming race as evidenced by 2024 results/raised 2025 guidance (especially relative to its streaming peers' results),\" Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak wrote in a recent note. \"This is what, in our opinion, winning looks like.\" Story Continues See more from the Opening Bid podcast Why Netflix and Amazon will dominate live sports Why everything still feels so expensive Do Trump tariffs make retail stocks totally untouchable? But before declaring the Big TV space officially swapped for a more pocket-sized medium, it looks as though big screens aren't going anywhere anytime soon. \"A lot of people, including me, like to watch on Big TV screens,\" said Levy. Meanwhile, major networks have also gotten in on the trend, like NBC with its companion streaming service Peacock. \"I think there's an opportunity even for the television business in the simulcasting business,\" Levy said. \"You're going to see that those media companies are going to buy it for cross-platform opportunities.\" Three times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

            "title": "Should First Trust Growth Strength ETF (FTGS) Be on Your Investing Radar?",
            "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-trust-growth-strength-etf-112005531.html",
            "ticker": "NFLX",
            "full_text": "Launched on 10/25/2022, the First Trust Growth Strength ETF (FTGS) is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to provide a broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market. The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors. It has amassed assets over $1.04 billion, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market. Why Large Cap Growth Companies that fall in the large cap category tend to have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies. Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Further, growth stocks have a higher level of volatility associated with them. They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer-term, value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets. Costs When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal. Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.60%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space. It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.38%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings It is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Financials sector--about 25.70% of the portfolio. Information Technology and Industrials round out the top three. Looking at individual holdings, Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK) accounts for about 2.56% of total assets, followed by Expedia Group, Inc. (EXPE) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX). The top 10 holdings account for about 23.19% of total assets under management. Performance and Risk FTGS seeks to match the performance of the THE GROWTH STRENGTH INDEX before fees and expenses. The Growth Strength Index provides exposure to a mix of domestic equities with filters for liquidity, return on equity, long-term debt, revenue and cash flow growth. The ETF has gained about 3.12% so far this year and it's up approximately 11.46% in the last one year (as of 02/17/2025). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $28.64 and $33.31. Story Continues The ETF has a beta of 1.16 and standard deviation of 15.72% for the trailing three-year period. With about 51 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Alternatives First Trust Growth Strength ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, FTGS is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Growth area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space. The Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) and the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) track a similar index. While Vanguard Growth ETF has $163.36 billion in assets, Invesco QQQ has $338.58 billion. VUG has an expense ratio of 0.04% and QQQ charges 0.20%. Bottom-Line An increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.

Federal Reserve Jerome Powell reiterated in testimony before the Senate and House that he saw no great reason to cut the Fed's key interest rate.

This year, there's really just a Magnificent One: Facebook-parent Meta Platforms  (META) , which was up 3.1% this past week and is up 25.8% just in the first six weeks of 2025. Much of that gain has come as Meta has risen for each of the past 20 trading days, rising 20.5% in the process. And don't forget: Meta was up 65% in 2024.

(NASDAQ:NFLX) stands against the other stocks. In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on why the flagship S&P index remained stable despite multiple catalysts such as a trade war, DeepSeek, and a new administration. Cramer believes that \"there's still an undercurrent that the President is good for business.\" He recalled how hedge fund billionaire David Tepper's comments about the market were precarious and didn't reflect the way it was behaving. Cramer outlined \"I mean yesterday we had an individual talking about how the situation's precarious on Squawk Box. And it's not.\" Instead, Cramer shared \"These are things where if you check the cadence of what happened, the President does something, it looks really, really harsh on Mexico. Claudia Sheinbaum comes back and says, you know what, I agree. Uh, the President does something it looks really harsh on Canada. And Canada comes back and says, let's make a talk. Let's do something. He does something that looks really harsh about China, it's not harsh at all. So China then comes back, I mean these are all signs that the President's strategy, I think people say, is working.\" As a result, he wondered why there was any need to sell stocks. Replying to his question, Cramer pointed out \"And the answer is why you would sell is because you don't believe in the President. And you think that the President has got a strategy that doesn't exist. I come back and say, well I don't know. I mean there was a lot of success yesterday, so why sell?\" The CNBC TV host also commented on a JPMorgan note saying that policy shifts are moving towards business unfriendliness. Cramer holds a mixed opinion in this regard. On one hand, while he countered by wondering \"how can it, look, deregulation is what businesses have been asking for. And they're getting that in spade,\" on the other hand he agreed that \"Yes, did President Trump not do it in the order we wanted? Which would be first we get big tax cuts, we get deregulation. And then after that, you what we're gonna hit them it [inaudible]. He went faster than that. And that was something that was perceived anti business.\" In fact, Cramer was surprised by the President's China approach. He had \"expected [a] sixty percent tariff on China. . . expected that the President would say listen, we will no longer import any steel from Mexico cause so much of it is from China. . . [and] thought that there would be tariffs on things that are necessary to China that would have made it horrible.\" Story Continues Further commenting on the White House's approach towards China, Cramer stated: \"If you're China you're saying, hey you know what, this guy really wants a deal with us. And let's sit down. Now I remember when the President . . .he said look I think that things could be better with China. Now if you go back and read Peter Navarro's book, about, when he talks about Trump and China. Oh man. There were people. . . Steve Mnuchin, who, he calls out, Navarro, as being China-poligists, and in a really harsh way, the book is. . . well written. And I just think that Navarro lost here, because these were not harsh.\" Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on February 4th. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

The firm has managed to consistently grow its subscriber base over the past year. More importantly, Netflix, Inc.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 179% in five years. It's also good to see the share price up 28% over the last quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report. On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Netflix To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Over half a decade, Netflix managed to grow its earnings per share at 37% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 23% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 51.98, the market remains optimistic. The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). NasdaqGS:NFLX Earnings Per Share Growth February 15th 2025 We know that Netflix has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained. A Different Perspective It's nice to see that Netflix shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 81% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 23% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Fallon (Getty Images) Almost 20 years after Netflix (NFLX) debuted its video streaming platform in 2007, the company has been able to maintain — as one Wall Street analyst put it — its “insurmountable lead in the streaming wars.” And that lead is only getting wider. Despite facing more competition than ever, Netflix recently reported its biggest growth in subscribers. The streaming giant said its paid memberships rose by 19 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing its total memberships to almost 302 million, globally. Additionally, its yearly revenue grew 16% to $39 billion last year. A key part of the company’s success lies in producing shows that keep subscribers engaged and watching.

            "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/47835fa9-bf4b-33df-83cb-5e97a8a2f14b/surprise%3A-mcdonald%27s-has.html",
            "ticker": "NFLX",
            "full_text": "Restaurants have notoriously low profit margins. But McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), the world's largest restaurant chain, is surprisingly one of the most profitable businesses. In fact, its profit margins are higher than prestigious businesses such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). I should clarify that profits can be measured from multiple angles. But one of the best ways to measure profits is with the operating margin. This metric excludes things that aren't related to regular business operations -- such as taxes, which can swing wildly from year to year -- and focuses only on the profits the business produces. On Feb. 10, McDonald's reported finalized financial results for 2024. During the year, the company had a stellar operating margin of 45%. That's among the very best in the world. And as the chart below shows, it's far better than the operating margin for companies such as Tesla, Apple, and Netflix. MCD Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts Assuming that the core business is burgers and fries, it would seem that McDonald's makes $45 in operating profit for every $100 it has in sales. This would suggest that its food is outrageously overpriced. But if you assume that selling food is the core business for McDonald's, you're wrong. McDonald's has operating margins as good or better than even the most profitable tech companies because it's not in the food business per se. And it's a really interesting thing for investors to note, as I'll explain. The secret sauce for McDonald's As of this writing, I'm still waiting on McDonald's to file its annual report, which contains more detailed financials than what it usually reports to investors. So allow me to mention some 2023 numbers for illustrative purposes. In 2023, McDonald's generated total revenue of $25.5 billion. Of this, it generated $15.4 billion (over 60% of its total revenue) from its franchised restaurants -- restaurants operated by independent third parties. The bulk of franchised revenue for McDonald's comes from a particularly surprising source. As it turns out, the company owns a lot of real estate that it rents out to its franchises. It generated $9.8 billion in rental income in 2023. McDonald's had over $27 billion in real estate at the end of 2023, when looking at land that it owned and buildings that were on land that it owned. This gives McDonald's the largest real estate portfolio of any restaurant company in the world. And this dynamic goes a long way to explaining why it has operating margins that are so high compared to other restaurant chains. Story Continues In other words, McDonald's primarily offers third-party franchisees an opportunity to run a restaurant business. The company provides franchisees with the brand, the system, and even the building. The franchisees sell the classic burgers and fries, which is a much lower-margin business. But the parent company gets royalties and rental income, which is so high-margin that even software companies are jealous. What does this mean for investors today? McDonald's expects its operating margin to further improve in 2025. And even a modest improvement could still result in a large increase in operating profits given how massive the business is. Another interesting thing to consider is that McDonald's has around 43,000 restaurant locations today but expects to surpass 50,000 in 2027. That's a 16% increase in just three years, which is pretty meaningful for a business of this size. And since most of the growth will come from franchisees, expect a respectable increase in its high-margin revenue streams. Given how big and high-margin this business is, I consider McDonald's stock as one of the safest investments someone could make -- in other words, I believe there's a low chance of losing money over the long term. Given McDonald's size, I'd say it doesn't necessarily have the highest upside potential. But it could still be worth holding, and it's worth watching in case the price ever dips to a particularly attractive valuation.

            "full_text": "In 2019, a woman walks below a Google sign on the campus in Mountain View, Calif. (Associated Press) More than a decade ago, outcries about the lack of diversity in the tech industry reverberated across major Silicon Valley companies from Facebook to Google. Women and minorities spoke out about feeling out of place in male-dominated professions, civil rights activists urged businesses to do more and tech workers like Tracy Chou, who was a software engineer at Pinterest at the time, pushed companies to release diversity data. “There was already some movement in that direction, at least a feeling like we should do this,” said Chou, who wrote a viral Medium post in 2013 about the lack of female engineers. “What I happened to crystallize was a line of thinking that really resonated with the more data-driven side of the industry.” For diversity advocates like Chou, the tide has now turned. Facing more political pressure and legal risks during President Trump’s second administration, tech companies that previously championed diversity including Google, Meta (Facebook’s parent company) and Amazon are scaling back, scrapping or rethinking their diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. Read more: Google ends hiring targets tied to diversity It's part of a broader retrenchment across the business community. About 20% of companies in the Standard & Poor's 100 have retreated from DEI commitments since Trump was elected, according to a Bloomberg News analysis. Those include Target Corp., McDonald’s Corp. and Disney. Trump and Elon Musk, who spent more than $200 million to help elect the president to a second term, have been vocal critics of DEI programs. In a fact sheet about Trump’s executive order, the White House said many corporations use DEI as “an excuse for biased and unlawful employment practices,” sending a message to businesses that they could get sued. Companies such as Google and Amazon also contract with federal agencies. “They're reading the room, especially with Trump and Elon running the country,” said Chou, now the chief executive of Block Party, a tool that helps users combat online harassment. Corporate pledges to fight racism including from Musk’s company Tesla heightened after the 2020 police murder of George Floyd, sparking massive protests against police brutality. But legal threats emerged in 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down race-based affirmative action in college admissions. As tech companies cut thousands of jobs, the massive cuts also hit DEI teams. Spending on DEI roles at S&P 500 companies started to fall in 2022 as mass layoffs swept the tech industry, data from Revelio Labs show. In November 2024, these businesses spent an estimated $1.3 billion on DEI roles, down 10% compared to the same month in 2022. Story Continues From December 2022 to December 2024, tech companies including Google's parent company Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon spent less on roles that promoted diversity and inclusion. During this period, Tesla's DEI spending was down by 84% and Meta's DEI spending declined by 53%, according to Revelio Labs, which analyzes data from various sources including online profiles on sites like LinkedIn or Jobcase. Read more: Once a Trump critic, Mark Zuckerberg pivots toward the president Tech companies have pointed to legal risks in internal memos about why they’re rethinking how they approach their DEI programs. “They wanted to keep President Trump on their good side, because they don't want to deal with any legal ramifications from the federal government,” said Jared Slater, partner at Ervin Cohen & Jessup. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Meta's Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, a former Trump critic who also said previously that improving diversity in tech is important, has in recent months aligned himself with the president and talked about the benefits of \"masculine energy.\" The company told its employees in an internal memo that the legal and policy landscape surrounding DEI changed and pointed to Supreme Court decisions. “The term ‘DEI’ has also become charged, in part because it is understood by some as a practice that suggests preferential treatment of some groups over others,” said Janelle Gale, Meta’s head of human resources, in an internal memo. The company said it wanted to serve everyone and would no longer use its “diversity slate approach” in which hiring managers consider candidates from underrepresented backgrounds when interviewing for an open role. Meta also ended representation goals for women and minorities, a program to source supplies from diverse-owned businesses and scrapped its DEI teams. Maxine Williams, Meta’s chief diversity officer, became the vice president of accessibility and engagement. Websites for Meta's unconscious bias training and TechPrep, a resource hub for underrepresented people and their parents to learn about computer science, are no longer online. Meta declined to comment but confirmed the memo, first published by Axios. Read more: Disney softens DEI efforts with Trump back in office Google said this month it was reevaluating its DEI programs “following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic.” The company said it would no longer set hiring targets tied to improving diversity after previously setting a goal of increasing by 30% the proportion of “leadership representation of underrepresented groups” by 2025. And Amazon told its employees that it’s “winding down” certain programs after evaluating their “effectiveness, impact and ROI [return on investment]” but didn’t specify which ones. In a December memo to employees reviewed by The Times, the company’s Vice President of inclusive experiences and technology Candi Castleberry told employees that the company is focused on “programs with proven outcomes\" while also aiming to \"foster a more truly inclusive culture.” Amazon shared the memo. Amazon Studios — which announced a series of ambitious inclusion goals in June 2021 — also has been making changes. Last September, the Culver City-based studio removed a public-facing inclusion playbook from its website along with a goal that films or series with three or more people in above-line roles such as directors and producers included at least 30% women and 30% members of an underrepresented group. “We’ve said from the beginning that our efforts to ensure diverse and inclusive storytelling would be fluid and change over time,\" Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser said in a statement. He added that the company strives to “tell the very best stories, while empowering diverse voices in our storytelling wherever possible.” Meanwhile, some tech companies such as Apple are fighting back against anti-DEI proposals from conservative shareholders. The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, is asking that Apple consider ending its DEI programs, policies, departments and goals. “The risks to the company's bottom line stem from potentially getting sued by individuals for discrimination, potentially getting legal action from the government for violating civil rights law, and then the market backlash,” said Stefan Padfield, executive director of the center’s Free Enterprise Project. Apple recommended that shareholders reject the proposal at the company's annual shareholder meeting on Feb. 25. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment, but the company said in a document to shareholders that the anti-DEI proposal was “unnecessary” partly because its board and management oversee legal and regulatory risks. Netflix has remained committed to DEI after Trump’s executive order, stating in its annual report that a “major focus” is “fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable” because it wants more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen. Read more: Amazon Studios wants half of its creative teams to be diverse by 2024 The Los Gatos-based streaming giant said in its annual report released in January that it educates its recruiters on how to hire more inclusively. A Netflix spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. “What we need to do in this moment in time is to stand up, to speak up, to be strategic and to keep moving forward,” said Vernā Myers, former Netflix vice president of inclusion strategy and founder of the Vernā Myers Co., a consultancy on diversity, equity and inclusion. “We can’t allow this kind of bullying to make us so fearful that we are paralyzed and that we draw back from our core values.” The backlash against DEI is not only affecting workplace culture, but nonprofits focused on recruiting more women and minorities into the tech industry. Last year, Women Who Code, a nonprofit that got its start in California, closed because of a lack of funding. AnitaB.org, which brings together women in tech at its annual Grace Hopper Celebration, cut its workforce in 2024 and pointed to a downturn in corporate DEI investments. Some diversity advocates like Freada Kapor Klein, co-chair of the Kapor Center, question whether some tech companies ever took DEI that seriously. Tech giants seemed more open to diversity efforts in times of talent shortages because it helps open up a pool of potential hires, she said. Now they’re rolling back DEI efforts amid layoffs and a political climate in which Republicans hold more power. “It is now fashionable to be anti-DEI. It's now fashionable to talk about masculine energy. It's now fashionable … to align oneself with MAGA interests,\" she said. \"So you have to kind of ask, what is it that people actually, really and truly believe?” Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

Negative Points Consolidated operating loss was $40 million for the year, including impairment and restructuring charges. Domestic operations revenues decreased by 9% for the full year, primarily due to linear subscriber declines. Advertising revenue decreased by 11% for the year, impacted by lower linear ratings and a challenging ad market.

AMC Networks Inc (NASDAQ:AMCX) expects total consolidated revenue for 2025 to decrease by approximately 5% compared to 2024. Story Continues Q & A Highlights Q: How does the free cash flow outlook relate to cash spending, and what factors contributed to the lower-than-expected cash spend in 2024? A: Patrick O'Connell, CFO, explained that the strategy remains focused on balancing programming investments with profitability. The lower cash spend in 2024 was due to efficient production and content sharing across platforms. The slight decrease in 2025 cash programming spend is attributed to modest reductions in volume and delayed tax credit receivables. Q: Can you elaborate on the streaming subscriber growth and the impact of bundled partnerships and the Netflix licensing deal? A: Patrick O'Connell noted that streaming subscriber growth was supported by bundled partnerships and the Netflix licensing deal. The company expects continued healthy streaming revenue growth in 2025, driven by price increases and unit volume. The Charter deal is included in the revenue guidance, with more details to come as it kicks in during Q1. Q: What impact does licensing content to Netflix have on viewership and linear ad revenue? A: Kim Kelleher, Chief Commercial Officer, clarified that the Netflix partnership is not ad-supported. Kristin Dolan, CEO, added that while there's no direct correlation with linear viewership, the Netflix effect has driven significant increases in AMC-Plus acquisitions as viewers seek new seasons of shows they watched on Netflix. Q: Are there specific projects being sold to third parties, or is content primarily for AMC's platforms? A: Dan McDermott, President of Entertainment and AMC Studios, stated that currently, content is produced mainly for AMC's platforms. However, the studio is open to producing for third parties when financially beneficial. The market remains receptive to AMC's programming, contributing to content licensing revenue growth. Q: What steps are being taken to balance the decline in linear advertising with digital growth? A: Kim Kelleher highlighted innovations in advertising, such as programmatic buying and cross-platform packaging, to make inventory more valuable and accessible. The introduction of AMC-Plus ad-supported inventory and the upcoming Shudder ad tier are expected to enhance digital advertising growth, gradually offsetting linear declines.

Today's call may include certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ.

Today, we will discuss certain non GAAP financial measures. The required definitions and reconciliations can be found in today's press release. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kristin. Kristin Dolan Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we get into the call, I wanted to say that we've been focused on supporting our employees and creative partners in Los Angeles during the recent devastating fires. We're thankful for the heroic efforts of firefighters and first responders and recognize the long term period of recovery and rebuilding that lies ahead for our people and the entire city. I also want to acknowledge the recent passing of our Founder and longtime Chairman, Charles Dolan, a visionary and industry icon who created businesses like Cablevision, HBO, and AMC Networks. Mr. Dolan always took a long range view in business, building companies and shaping industries with a clear strategic vision. We have the privilege and responsibility of continuing that approach today and into the future as we execute on our core strengths and advantages and navigate the changing world of media. Now to our results. As we look back on the fourth quarter and full year 2024, I'm encouraged by our progress. Patrick will report on our financial results and outlook in greater detail, but I'm pleased to report that even in this uncertain and shifting environment, we achieved our full year guidance for 2024. This includes consolidated revenue of $2,4 million, consolidated AOI of $563 million and most importantly, free cash flow of $331 million. Free cash flow generation has been strong and today we are increasing our outlook to approximately $550 million of cumulative free cash flow over the '24, '25 period. At a time when all media companies are facing challenges, our size, nimbleness and independence allow us to move quickly to create new opportunities for ourselves and for our partners. Our innovative mentality is driving our approach to content creation, distribution, advertising and new partnerships. This freedom and ability to take a more imaginative approach to our business played out in a number of ways over the past year. We ended 2023 with an unconventional experiment to put some of our shows on the Mac streaming service, where they quickly became top titles. In 2024, we built on this success with an expansive branded licensing agreement with Netflix that featured prior seasons of more than a dozen of our shows, including some of our most important franchises. We believed exposure on this massive platform would boost viewer awareness and interest in our titles and that's exactly what happens. The exclusive availability of current seasons on AMC plus drove viewership and acquisition on our own platform. The Walking Dead: The Once You Live was added to Netflix last month and appeared on the platform's US top 10 list the following day and remained there for weeks, rising as high as number two, ahead of Squid Game and other titles. As we prepare for the return of The US Streaming rights to the original The Walking Dead series in less than two years, it's great to see continued strong interest in this very active and vibrant universe. Our partnership and bundling activity continued in the fourth quarter. We launched a two month content exchange with MGM Plus to promote sampling and drive subscriptions on our respective platforms. Subscribers on both sides of the exchange reacted positively. We saw double digit gains in engagement and acquisition on AMC plus led by the sci-fi horror series from and The Walking Dead Daryl Dixon was a top performer for MGM Plus spending multiple weeks in its top 10 list and peaking at number two. We expanded access to the AMC-plus and STARS bundle by making it available through VIZIO. We offered new bundles through Verizon and brought AMC plus to platforms like Philo with a very positive consumer response. These arrangements helped drive healthy streaming subscriber additions in the fourth quarter. They also underscore the strength of our AMC Studios IP and ability to partner and reach viewers in new ways. As audiences continue to fragment, our number one goal as a company is to produce and curate great shows and films and make that content as easy as possible for viewers to find in a very crowded and noisy world. This strategy requires management of our own platforms and strong relationships with our distribution partners. In 2024, we renewed agreements representing about half of our US Linear footprint, including multiyear deals with Charter, Cox, Verizon and Cable One, among others. And a reminder that our Charter deal will make AMC plus available at no additional cost to all Spectrum customers who receive AMC as part of their TV package. This is in keeping with Charter's broader strategy to bundle streaming value into its video service and will significantly expand the universe of people who have access to AMC plus. In the last twenty four months, we renewed the vast majority of our Canadian distribution footprint with agreements that include easy access to AMC plus for our partners video and broadband customers. We also saw a significant expansion of our fast channel distribution with major launches on platforms like Roku and Prime Video, and we closed a long term renewal with Amazon Prime Video channels for the distribution of our streaming services. We kicked off our 2025, 2026 up front last week, hosting some of our most important longstanding commercial partners at an event spotlighting our technological leadership in advertising. Building upon previous advances in addressable and programmatic buying through our Audience plus platform, we unveiled a groundbreaking attribution product called AMCN Outcomes. We now give our advertising partners real time insights into purchasing decisions that are driven by consumers' exposure to our partners' marketing messages, another meaningful first for AMC Networks. And later this year, as previously announced, we will launch an ad supported version of our popular Shutter streaming service. Let me share a few programming highlights across our linear networks, targeted streaming services and film business. The fourth quarter included our two biggest annual programming events on AMC and AMC plus Fear Fest and Best Christmas Ever. On linear TV, AMC finished the quarter as a top 10 entertainment network with adults 25 to 54 with Fear Fest and Best Christmas Ever driving the network to its highest rated months of the year in October and December. BCE also attracted a record number of sponsors and advertising partners this year. On streaming, Fear Fest drove AMC plus to record movie viewership with best Christmas ever also showing double-digit year-over-year growth in film viewership. We TV remains the number one entertainment network on Friday nights among women in the 25 to 54 demo. In 2024, We TV had two of the top 3 cable originals on Friday nights among women 25 to 54, including Mama June and Love After Lockup, which is also the number one Friday original among black women 25 to 54, followed by The Braxton’s at number two. The Braxton’s finished its first season as WE TV's highest rated new reality series in more than three years. BBC America, which we now fully own, just premiered the most recent BBC Natural History tentpole series, the stunning Planet Earth Asia, again narrated by Sir David Attenborough. We are excited to kick off 2025 with a robust slate of highly anticipated new original programming, including the second season of Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches and the highly anticipated third season of Dark Winds exclusively on AMC and AMC-plus. We are excited for the return of Dark Winds on March 9 after the series’ first two seasons spent an uninterrupted month on the Netflix top 10 list last summer. This year we'll see the return of The Walking Dead: Dead City, a thrilling new series called Nautilus, the third season of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon set in Spain, and a new series in our growing Anne Rice Immortal universe called Anne Rice's Tallamasqua: The Secret Order. Our targeted streaming services continue to delight viewers with the depth of content in distinct categories that are not available anywhere else. Shudder had an incredible year releasing six of the top 10 horror films of 2024 as ranked by Rotten Tomatoes. Acorn TV brought fans another season of Jane Seymour in Harry Wyld, Sharon D. Clark and Inspector Ellis and will premiere a new series called Irish Blood starring Alicia Silverstone later this year. This is a sample of the depth and appeal our targeted streaming services offer as research shows streaming subscribers continue to seek out special and distinctive as opposed to more of the same. IFC Films had a fantastic year. Its diverse slate included critically acclaimed titles like Memoir of a Snail, Ghost Light, The Taste of Things and Late Night with the Devil, which set an opening weekend box office record for the company. I want to congratulate everyone at IFC Films for the recent Oscar nomination for Memoir of a Snail in the Best Animated Feature category. We are all incredibly proud of the film and grateful for this recognition. We've consistently emphasized programming, partnerships and profitability as our key priorities in running this business and moving the company forward. As we look back on our 2024 results and look forward to a productive year ahead, I'd like to also recognize our people. This is not an easy or straightforward time to be working in media, but as I see your progress, I'm thankful for our collective ability to adapt, evolve and lean into the advantages and strengths we bring to this dynamic and changing marketplace. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick for a detailed look at our financial results. Story Continues Patrick O Connell Thank you, Kristin. I'm pleased to report today that 2024 landed right where we said it would. As a nimble and innovative premium programmer, we've maintained focus on what is within our control despite a challenging linear environment. We are proud of the progress we've made over the last two years, including reorienting our business around free cash flow, investing in valuable world class IP and remaining focused on our balance sheet. We achieved our full year guidance for 2024. Consolidated revenue was $2.4 million. On an apples to apples basis, excluding 2023 revenue from 25/7 Media, Silo, the Hulu return of rights and 2024 revenue related to the one time advertising revenue adjustments at AMC and I, consolidated revenue decreased 6%. Consolidated operating loss was $40 million and included impairment and other charges of $400 million and restructuring charges of $49 million. Consolidated adjusted operating income was $563 million and most importantly, we delivered significant year-over-year free cash flow growth with free cash flow of $331 million. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $599 million. Consolidated operating loss was $254 million and included impairment and other charges of $303 million and restructuring charges of $43 million. Adjusted operating income was $129 million and we generated free cash flow of $38 million. I'll now discuss our segment results. Domestic operations revenues decreased 9% to $2.1 million for the full year and decreased 11% to $520 million for the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue decreased 5% for the full year and 4% for the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to linear subscriber declines resulting in a 13% decline in affiliate revenue for both the year and the quarter. This was partially offset by streaming revenue growth of 7% for the year and 8% for the quarter. We ended the year with 12.4 million streaming subs representing year-over-year increase of 8%. Domestic operations advertising revenue decreased 11% for the year and 12% for the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower linear ratings and a challenging ad market for entertainment and was partially offset by continued digital growth. Digital advertising revenue, including addressable and revenue from our Fast and Avod offerings, continues to grow at a double digit rate. And in 2024, this digital revenue represented approximately a quarter of our overall domestic operations ad revenue. Content licensing revenue was $277 million for the full year and $67 million for the fourth quarter. There were a couple of items in 2023 that impacted the comparability of our 2024 results, including the final delivery of AMC Studios produced episodes of Silo to Apple and the early return of rights from Hulu, which resulted in $56 million and $20 million of one time revenue in 2023, respectively. Excluding these items, our full year licensing revenue increased 4%. As our library grows every year, we have more SKUs to sell and while some of our bigger ticket shows like Fear the Walking Dead contributed less meaningfully toward 2024 results as compared to 2023, this was more than offset by new business including Netflix, Sky in The UK, and increased licensing volume from our targeted services. Domestic operations AOI was $62 million for the full year and $152 million for the quarter. Margins for both the full year and fourth quarter were 29%. The year-over-year decrease in AOI for the full year was largely driven by continued linear revenue headwinds. For the fourth quarter, the increase in AOI is primarily driven by lower expenses and streaming revenue growth, partly offset by linear revenue headwinds. Moving to our International segment. International revenue included advertising revenue related to retroactive onetime adjustments reported by a third party of $21 million for the full year and $7 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding 25/7 Media, which we divested a year ago, and the onetime adjustments I just mentioned, international revenues decreased 3% for the full year and increased 2% for the quarter. On an Apples-to-Apples basis, advertising revenues grew 16% and 12% for the full year and fourth quarter, respectively. This was largely the result of the strong performance of our AVOD offerings on the ITVX in The UK, as well as increased ratings and growth across our Central and Northern European advertising markets. Subscription revenues declined 11% for the full year and 5% for the quarter. For the full year, the decrease in subscription revenue was attributable to the non-renewal of a distribution agreement in The UK that occurred in the prior year. For the quarter, the decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable FX. Moving to international AOI. Excluding the onetime adjustments to advertising revenue, full year AOI was $45 million with a 15% margin and fourth quarter AOI was $1 million. On to the balance sheet. We ended the year with net debt of $1.6 million and a consolidated net leverage ratio of 2.8 times. We remain focused on our balance sheet and we're pleased with the results of our efforts over the last 24 months. This includes gross debt reduction of approximately [$0.5 million] and the completion of a series of financings that extended our maturity profile, now with no bond maturities until 2029. Additionally, we've maintained a healthy cash position and ended the year with approximately $1 billion in total liquidity. This includes $785 million of cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn $175 million revolver. We appreciate the flexibility and optionality of our meaningful cash balance and continue to expect that our capital structure will present attractive opportunities for us over time. Our capital allocation philosophy remains prudent and opportunistic. First, we look to support the business by creating and acquiring compelling programming that resonates with our audiences, while maintaining healthy levels of cash flow generation. Second, we remain focused on continually improving our balance sheet by reducing gross debt and optimizing our capital structure. Lastly, M&A, share repurchases and dividends remain further down our priority list. Moving on to our outlook for 2025. I'll start with our most important metric, free cash flow. As Kristin mentioned, on the heels of strong cash generation we delivered in 2024, we are pleased to update our outlook today for the two year period ending 2025. We now expect to generate cumulative free cash flow of approximately $550 million by the end of 2025. This implies approximately $220 million of free cash flow for the full year 2025. Our outlook contemplates increased cash interest payments resulting from the recent refinancing activity as well as a year-over-year increase in cash taxes as we lap certain tax benefits recognized in 2024. Looking at revenue for 2025, we expect total consolidated revenue for the full year 2025 to decrease approximately 5% as compared to 2024, implying total revenue of approximately $2.3 million. As it is still early in the year, the geography of certain revenue and expense items may shift as the year unfolds. Notwithstanding that, I'll unpack the current assumptions that underpin our outlook. First, regarding domestic operations subscription revenue, we expect 2025 subscription revenue to be flat as compared to 2024. We anticipate that linear subscriber headwinds will persist and will result in slightly worse year-over-year affiliate revenue growth as compared to 2024. This will be offset by accelerated streaming growth. Streaming revenue growth will be driven by price increases, expanded distribution of our offerings and discretionary marketing investments. As such, we expect streaming revenue growth in the low to mid-teens percent area as compared to 2024. With respect to advertising revenue, as I mentioned earlier, digital advertising revenue growth remains robust and we're now growing off a more meaningful base. Notwithstanding that, the linear ratings environment and entertainment ad marketplace continues to be challenging. Therefore, we expect 2025 domestic advertising revenue to decline approximately 10% as compared to 2024. Content licensing remains an important source of revenue for us and we continue to be innovative, progressive and disciplined regarding this important revenue stream. As you know, licensing revenues are often deal dependent and can be lumpy due to timing or shifting delivery schedules. Today, across the many desirable titles in our library, we anticipate approximately $250 million of domestic operations content licensing revenue for 2025. For AMC Networks International, we expect revenue in the range of $290 million to $300 million for the full year 2025. As I discussed earlier, we recognized $21 million of onetime adjustments that benefited advertising revenue in 2024. For 2025, excluding these 2024 adjustments, we expect year-over-year international advertising revenue growth. Additionally, we anticipate the subscription revenue will decrease year-over-year, largely owed to a recent non-renewal with Movistar in Spain. We expect that this non-renewal will represent a $15 million headwind to both revenue and AOI in the segment. Moving to expenses. For 2025, we expect consolidated technical and operating expenses to increase as compared to 2024, driven by higher non amortization technical and operating expenses, including certain duplicate expenses related to our technology outsourcing transformation. This will be partly offset by year-over-year decrease in programming amortization related to our 2025 slate timing and composition and programming write-offs that occurred in 2024. For SG&A, we anticipate a year-over-year increase in SG&A expense for 2025, primarily related to increased streaming related marketing investments focused on driving retention which we anticipate will drive profitable streaming growth. In terms of consolidated adjusted operating income, while we see strong streaming and digital advertising revenue growth and expect our portfolio of streaming services will contribute to our consolidated AOI in 2025. The dynamics I just discussed, including continued linear revenue headwinds and year-over-year expense growth, remain the primary factors in driving our AOI outlook. As such, we expect consolidated AOI for the full year to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million. Cash programming spend can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And for 2025, we expect a slight decrease in year-over-year cash programming spend due to the timing of our programming commitments. As Kristen said earlier, we take a long range view of the business and we're managing AMC Networks with a clear strategic plan centered around programming, partnerships and profitability. As we enter our third year since reorienting the business, this strategy continues to animate our market approach. Our commitment to creating high quality content remains at the center of everything we do. As an independent, nimble and innovative premium programmer, we approach the marketplace a bit differently than others, including building out our library of powerful franchises, monetizing our content across an evolving distribution ecosystem and driving profitable outcomes. We'll continue to preserve capital with a focus on our balance sheet and cash flow generation and balance appropriate levels of programming investment against the available monetization opportunities. Operator, please open the line for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Thomas Yeh, Morgan Stanley. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow outlook in the context of your cash spending comments. The $930 million of cash spend you put up, I think, in this year ended up being a little bit lower than the [$1 billion] you guided to and you spoke to further decreases in 2025. How much of that is timing versus just an increased focus on efficiency and your outlook updated in terms of how you see the potential opportunity for putting new content to work in the system? Patrick O Connell Sure, great. Hey, Thomas, this is Patrick. Thanks for the question. Our strategy remains the same, right, which is bouncing investments in our programming with driving profitability in the business. Obviously, programming is our largest expense category. We're extraordinarily focused on maintaining a portfolio of super high quality scripted programming across linear streaming etcetera. We continue to do that even as others have pulled back from the market and frankly the differentiator in many of our affiliate conversations. So the strategy has not changed. In terms of the specifics, free cash, the cash programming spend came in a little bit lighter in 2024 than we had initially guided to. This is us just being prudent. We're able to produce on a per episode basis a little bit better than we expected. We've got some fantastic people internally who are taking it available or taking advantage of all the tools available to produce efficiently. So we've been the beneficiary of that. And we have also instituted a program where we're sharing more content across channels, platforms, etcetera, that's allowed us to sort of program the broader company a bit more efficiently. But we obviously remain committed to similar levels of cash programming spend going forward. So I would say efficiency was kind of the other reason for the B quote unquote in 2024. Slight reductions in volume going forward, but not significant. We're producing at similar volumes going forward into 2025. The slight sort of decrease that I expect in cash programming for 2025 has to do with sort of those two factors, I would say. One, modest reductions in volume, but not anything dramatic. And then two, and you might appreciate this, there is a lag in our receipt of certain tax credit receivables and those are going to there's a bunch of them they're going to hit in 2025. So those net out against our cash programming expenses and that's driving part of the reduction in the year-over-year decline. Kristin Dolan And just wanted to reiterate and we were pretty specific about it in the script that the quality of the content that Dan and team continue to produce is it's very reassuring to see the attention we got on Netflix, the Oscar nod, for memoir and just overall the response that we have and engagement that we have to the shows that we're producing. And we've really been able to capitalize in Wind shows like Daryl Dixon, where we're filming in Spain or in France on tax efficiencies. We have some shows planned in Canada. We do a lot in Ireland. So we're really optimizing without in any way compromising the integrity and the quality of what's coming out of our shop. Okay, understood. That's helpful. And some nice momentum in the streaming subscriber growth continued into 4Q. It sounded like bundled partnerships helped, but also the Netflix licensing deal was a contributor as well. Can you maybe just tease out the balance of the contribution between those two and how we kind of see the outlook being supported in 2025 from a volume perspective in AMC plus and maybe the future of the targeted streaming services? And then if I could just squeeze one last one in that same kind of context. Just a clarification on the guide, is the Charter deal showing up in some allocated form between affiliate and streaming in terms of the subcomponents, Patrick, that you provided? Thank you. Patrick O Connell Yes, sure. Great. Thanks, Thomas. Yes, listen, on the streaming subs, listen, we continue to have pretty good momentum across all of our services. And when you look at it across the entire business, we had sort of the lowest churn or we had year-over-year declines in churn on a consolidated basis across the portfolio. So obviously retaining subscribers kind of helps drive the numbers. We've also, as you pointed out, been the beneficiary of some fantastic kind of bundled arrangements as Kristin has talked about a lot. We are very nimble, very flexible. We love to partner with others. We're highly complementary. We think it adds value into the ecosystem. It's great for consumers. It's obviously great for us in terms of being able to distribute product with a little bit less kind of hard marketing dollars. So those are very efficient go to market channels for us. As we look forward into 2025, we're expecting really healthy streaming revenue growth that will be driven by a lot of price action, but also kind of unit volume as well. So we're really excited about this momentum. And I'd point out for folks that if you unpack the guide, you'll notice that we've called out sort of flat subscription revenue year-over-year. So that implies almost $100 million of incremental streaming revenue here, which is going to essentially offset some of the secular declines in the business. So super excited about that. In terms of the specific geography on the guide in terms of revenue, you should assume that that charter deal is baked into the specific revenue line items that we gave. More to come on, end up with that importantly that deal doesn't kick in until Q1. So we'll have more to say in terms of the details in terms of subscribers, but you should just take the guidance face value at this point. Charter deals baked in. Kristin Dolan And just to add on the streaming equation, the partnerships that we're engaging in for bundles are important, but also our relationships with our wholesalers. So Amazon, Roku, Philo, other folks that we participate with in addition to the traditional MVPDs are really critical and they are great partners in giving us data and insights around our subscribers and our utilization. So we're getting smarter and better at really identifying in a privacy compliant way, who's watching what and how to engage with them in addition to the communications that are coming from their subscription provider. So Amazon is talking to a customer, we know, but then we can supplement that conversation with specific sort of nods and suggestions to keep the engagement level high. And then I'm particularly proud here of the team really learning and taking a page from sort of the cable vision playbook on triple play and retention marketing that we're getting really sophisticated and smarter about retaining customers as opposed to just going after and spending subscriber acquisition money to bring them on board. So we're learning a lot and heavily focused on retention, which obviously will pay for itself in the long run. Operator David Joyce, Seaport Research Partners. Thank you. Could you please provide some more color on what kind of lift in viewership and linear ad revenue that you are interpolating is probably coming from licensing your content to Netflix. And given you did say there's double digit growth of digital advertising, just was wondering what it will take to get that whole segment, including linear, to get closer to matching the Connected TV ad growth? Thanks. Kim Kelleher Sure. David, this is Kim Kelleher. Thanks for your question. I'd just clarify that the Netflix partnership is not ad supported on platform even though our shows are distributed on both their ad tier and on their ad free tier if they are distributed in a no ad way. So there is well, I just want to clarify that one point. But to your next question, I do believe we are making great progress. The innovation we're doing in advertising, which is really focused on three areas. It's to make our inventory more available to buy seamlessly, to use data, as Kristen just talked about, and targeting to make our inventory more valuable. And then last, packaging our inventory in a cross platform way so that marketers can access our full scale of viewership at once regardless of how they watch TV. So we've mentioned on past calls, we've innovated with making our debut with industry first biddable programmatic buying capabilities embedded across our linear networks. We have added AMC plus ad supported inventory to our cross platform solutions, and that's been incredibly well received by the marketplace. We're adding a shutter ad tier, as Patrick just talked about in Q1. So that will add inventory as well. Sorry, I meant to say in fall. And then it's that way we package that inventory, like really delivering full genres to advertisers that are looking for targeted cohorts and audiences, really engaged fan communities, and it's working incredibly well. Most recently, as Kristen talked about in her remarks at the top, we launched Outcomes, our new performance product that's built into our Audience plus insights and data targeting platform, and this allows advertisers to see campaign outcomes and optimize delivery in real time. So what I'm saying is, cumulatively, we are making tracks towards leveling out the differential between the declining linear environment and the growth in our digital environment. It's just going to take a little bit of time. Yes. Appreciate that. What I was looking for, I guess, was how are you interpolating your licensing to Netflix into what kind of incremental viewership you're attracting on your linear properties, like the new seasons of what you've put on to Netflix, for example? Kristin Dolan I think it's not so much, I guess, the direct correlation with linear, but I would say, what we're thrilled about is as we are launching the new seasons of these shows that were on Netflix prior, we're seeing significant increases in AMC plus acquisition based on people watching the earlier seasons on Netflix. So we definitely see a strong correlation between they viewed it on the massive platform that is Netflix and then they're hungry for more, so they come back to us, and purchase AMC Plus to see that latest, which is exactly why we -- it's the Netflix effect that we talked about on the last call and that's definitely has worked really well for us. Understood. And just one final thing, if I could please. On the content licensing, are there specific projects that are being sold to third parties like you did with Silo, Hulu? Or is everything still going to be for your -- before your services, the first? Yes. David, this is Dan McDermott from the Studio side. Currently, we're producing pretty much exclusively for our AMC owned platforms right now. We do have a studio we are able to produce for third parties when it's beneficial to us and it makes financial sense. We do have a lot of interest in our studio content. So we're going to be strategic and opportunistic as we go forward. And when it makes sense and we can generate revenue and it will be accredited to the business, we'll explore those opportunities. -- Patrick O Connell And David, it's Patrick from the finance side. You'll recall the guide last year for 2024 was $225 million of run rate content licensing revenue. That was based on our current level of production. We're at $250 million this year, right? So I just wanted to did that help sort of contextualize the fact that one, we continue to produce that in a very healthy levels and two, the market continues to be extraordinarily receptive to the programming that we're producing. So it's a it was a net growth driver in 2024 and we think it's going to continue to be a tailwind at 2025. Operator Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Nick Seibert for any closing remarks. Nicholas Seibert Thank you all for joining us today. Have a good day. Operator Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day. View Comments"

            "full_text": "We recently published an article titled Was Jim Cramer Right About These 12 Stocks? In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. Back then, Cramer was focused on the impact of future rate cuts and how different stocks would react. He argued that the market had become simple: \"Stocks that benefit from rate cuts get bought. Stocks that don’t benefit get sold.” At that time, Cramer pointed to McDonald’s as an example of a rate-cut winner, despite the company having weak earnings at the time, saying: “This market doesn’t care that it’s doing badly. It just treats the Golden Arches as a rate-cut winner.” Meanwhile, he appeared rather bearish around big tech at the time. He warned against buying the “Magnificent 7”, saying that while they had thrived despite rate hikes, they wouldn’t necessarily benefit as rates came down. Here’s how he put it back then: \"For years now, the market has been rallying on companies that don’t need to borrow money, that don’t need rate cuts. But the flip side is that they won’t really benefit as rates come down.\" Tech stocks were under pressure at that time, and Cramer saw no short-term relief: \"For tech, the watchword is three words my staff loves to say: get out now.” Cramer expressed some interesting opinions in that particular show. Let’s see how each prediction unfolded 7 months later. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on July 30, 2024. We then calculated their performance from July 30th, 2024, market close to February 14th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Note: This article covers Jim Cramer’s commentary from July 30, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Story Continues NVIDIA (NVDA) Retains Buy Rating as Analysts Remain Optimistic on AI Growth A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 217 At the time, Cramer was watching NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) struggle, not because of business fundamentals, but due to the market rotation. He opened with the following: \"Nvidia is doing amazing things with generative AI and accelerated computing—two of the biggest trends of our day. But that’s not enough right now. Wall Street’s become a lot less willing to pay up for growth stocks.\" Cramer emphasized the selling pressure that the stock was seeing on the date the show aired, joking: \"Thank heavens they ring a bell at the close because then it can stop going down.” However, Cramer saw that decline as a buying opportunity, saying: \"Right now, the Street expects NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to earn $3.59 per share next year. But if this is like the Nvidia we’ve seen in the last decade, they could earn $4.59 per share. That would mean a stock selling at less than 23 times earnings. I am not selling the greatest growth stock of our generation at 23 times earnings.\" While rate-cut beneficiaries were winning, according to his view of the market at the time, Cramer believed Nvidia’s time would come again, suggesting that investors should stick with the company, even if there was short-term pain: \"At some point, a stock like Nvidia gets so cheap, so darn cheap, that the selling will stop. Unless you think NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is General Custer, you should come out ahead.” However, it looks like the selling did not only stop, but it overwhelmingly turned into buying, as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has surged by 34% since. Overall NVDA ranks 12th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other stocks. In a recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on why the flagship S&P index remained stable despite multiple catalysts such as a trade war, DeepSeek, and a new administration. Cramer believes that \"there's still an undercurrent that the President is good for business.\" He recalled how hedge fund billionaire David Tepper's comments about the market were precarious and didn't reflect the way it was behaving. Cramer outlined \"I mean yesterday we had an individual talking about how the situation's precarious on Squawk Box. And it's not.\" Instead, Cramer shared \"These are things where if you check the cadence of what happened, the President does something, it looks really, really harsh on Mexico. Claudia Sheinbaum comes back and says, you know what, I agree. Uh, the President does something it looks really harsh on Canada. And Canada comes back and says, let's make a talk. Let's do something. He does something that looks really harsh about China, it's not harsh at all. So China then comes back, I mean these are all signs that the President's strategy, I think people say, is working.\" As a result, he wondered why there was any need to sell stocks. Replying to his question, Cramer pointed out \"And the answer is why you would sell is because you don't believe in the President. And you think that the President has got a strategy that doesn't exist. I come back and say, well I don't know. I mean there was a lot of success yesterday, so why sell?\" The CNBC TV host also commented on a JPMorgan note saying that policy shifts are moving towards business unfriendliness. Cramer holds a mixed opinion in this regard. On one hand, while he countered by wondering \"how can it, look, deregulation is what businesses have been asking for. And they're getting that in spade,\" on the other hand he agreed that \"Yes, did President Trump not do it in the order we wanted? Which would be first we get big tax cuts, we get deregulation. And then after that, you what we're gonna hit them it [inaudible]. He went faster than that. And that was something that was perceived anti business.\" In fact, Cramer was surprised by the President's China approach. He had \"expected [a] sixty percent tariff on China. . . expected that the President would say listen, we will no longer import any steel from Mexico cause so much of it is from China. . . [and] thought that there would be tariffs on things that are necessary to China that would have made it horrible.\" Story Continues Further commenting on the White House's approach towards China, Cramer stated: \"If you're China you're saying, hey you know what, this guy really wants a deal with us. And let's sit down. Now I remember when the President . . .he said look I think that things could be better with China. Now if you go back and read Peter Navarro's book, about, when he talks about Trump and China. Oh man. There were people. . . Steve Mnuchin, who, he calls out, Navarro, as being China-poligists, and in a really harsh way, the book is. . . well written. And I just think that Navarro lost here, because these were not harsh.\" Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on February 4th.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Specializing in AI-Driven Solutions Across Multiple Industries A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's largest GPU designer whose stock has long been a bellwether for investor sentiment regarding AI. However, following January's DeepSeek selloff that saw NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares bleed 17% in a day, investors are now on the sidelines to determine whether the billions of dollars in expected GPU spending will materialize. Cramer also believes that GPU orders are the key to evaluating NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s stock now. Here's what he said about the firm: \"but we have some tech doing badly. And I think that the tech that's doing badly, once again its NVIDIA which is coming back. But we don't know what NVIDIA's going to report, there's a [inaudible] I've got NVIDIA saying that we're trophy in terms of negativity.

            "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b022b996-c9f0-31ee-9d07-27c6c485ef3a/billionaire-israel-englander.html",
            "ticker": "NVDA",
            "full_text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have advanced 180% since January 2024 amid incredible demand for its artificial intelligence platforms. But billionaire Israel Englander, CEO of hedge fund Millennium Management, sold down his position in the fourth quarter, while buying shares of AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP), an AI stock up 1,180% since January 2024. Englander sold 1.1 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his position by 10%. Nvidia is still the fifth-largest position in his portfolio excluding options contracts. Englander bought 808,973 shares of AppLovin, increasing his position by 114%. AppLovin now ranks among the 20 largest positions in his hedge fund excluding options. Englander is a good source of inspiration for investors because Millennium Management is the third most successful hedge fund in history as measured by net gains since inception, according to LCH Investment. Read on to learn more about Nvidia and AppLovin. Nvidia: The stock Israel Englander sold in the fourth quarter Nvidia specializes in accelerated computing, a discipline that combines specialized hardware and software to speed up difficult data center workloads like artificial intelligence (AI). While the company is best known for graphics processing units (GPUs), chips often called AI accelerators, Nvidia is particularly formidable because it participates in so many parts of the AI economy. Susquehanna estimates Nvidia has 84% market share in AI accelerators, but the company complements its GPUs with adjacent hardware like central processing units and networking platforms. In fact, Morningstar estimates Nvidia has over 50% market share in networking gear used for generative AI workloads, and expects the company to maintain its leadership through at least 2028. Nvidia reported impressive financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in October, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 94% to $35 billion and non-GAAP net income surged 103% to $0.81 per diluted share, marking the sixth consecutive quarter in which the company reported triple-digit earnings growth. Nvidia has an important catalyst in the recent launch of its Blackwell GPU, which handles AI training up to four times faster and AI inference up to 30 times faster than its previous Hopper GPU. CEO Jensen Huang told shareholders last year, \"The Blackwell architecture platform will likely be the most successful product in our history and even in the entire computer history.\" Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 39% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 53 times adjusted earnings look quite reasonable, which begs the question: Why did Englander sell shares in the fourth quarter? I suspect he was simply moving money to address other opportunities. I doubt he has lost confidence in Nvidia when the stock is still the fifth-largest holding in his hedge fund apart from options contracts. Story Continues AppLovin: The stock Israel Englander bought in the fourth quarter AppLovin provides ad tech software that help mobile developers market and monetize their applications. The company also provides tools that serve the same purpose for connected TV (CTV) publishers, and it recently introduced an e-commerce marketing product that lets brands reach consumers through mobile advertising. AppLovin has distinguished itself with Axon, a machine learning algorithm that targets ad content in a highly effective manner. Several years ago, it began acquiring game studios to train Axon, and it launched a more sophisticated version called Axon 2.0 in 2023. Improved recommendation capabilities led to an increase in advertisers spending, which has translated into strong financial performances in recent quarters. AppLovin reported fourth-quarter financial results that crushed Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 44% to $1.4 billion and GAAP earnings surged 253% to $0.49 per diluted share. \"During the quarter, our advertising business continued to drive increased performance for our mobile gaming partners, combined with positive early results for e-commerce advertisers during the holiday season,\" said CFO Matt Stumpf. Importantly, AppLovin also announced plans to sell its game development studios for $900 million. That will benefit the company in two ways. First, revenue from its apps actually fell in the most recent quarter, so the divestiture will eliminate the weakest part of the business. Second, it will streamline operations by allowing AppLovin to focus solely on its ad tech software, including its nascent e-commerce product. Wall Street estimates AppLovin's earnings will increase at 42% annually through 2026. That makes the current valuation of 112 times earnings look relatively expensive. But among the 30 analysts that follow AppLovin, the median target price is $538 per share. That implies 5% upside from the current share price of $510. Even so, investors that buy shares today should keep their positions small given the elevated valuation. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?

Analysts predict first-quarter predictions will face tough challenges despite anticipating a slight earnings beat in fiscal fourth-quarter results from Nvidia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Three main obstacles facing BofA affect Blackwell architecture implementation, Hopper-based chip sales weakening, and existing China trade limitations. The firm maintains strong positive views about Nvidia's future outlook while continuing to rate it as the top selection in its industry sector. The market expects Nvidia to recover its performance strength as it attracts investor attention from upcoming product releases. BofA emphasizes that it positions itself as a computing platform rather than being limited to chip production, making its hardware-software integration the main advantage for AI performance. Nvidia currently holds ratings at the lower end of its historical range as investors value the company at 31 times and 24 times its projected 2025 and 2026 earnings. The March 17 GTC conference holds the potential to act as a major catalyst because analysts predict end-of-month chip reveals and robotics and quantum computing expansion by Nvidia. Semiconductor stock performance continues as a positive trend because the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index registered a 3% increase last week, while the S&P 500 only gained 1.5% during the same period.

            "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/m/de81d50b-018c-3496-a737-b89efc80b48a/ai-stock-sell-off%3A-1.html",
            "ticker": "NVDA",
            "full_text": "Although the artificial intelligence (AI) sell-off due to DeepSeek's generative AI model innovation was short-lived, a handful of stocks are still off their peaks. One of them is AI king Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), a company that provides the computing power necessary to train all of these AI models. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is still over 10% down from its 2025 high, although it was down over 20% at the depths of the sell-off. I still think this slight sale price represents a fantastic buying opportunity, as the stock looks primed to soar after Feb. 26. What's so important about Feb. 26? On Feb. 26, Nvidia will report its fourth-quarter of fiscal year 2025 earnings (ending around Jan. 31). Nvidia's earnings report has become quite the event because everyone is curious if they are going to continue posting ludicrous growth numbers. For Q4, management expects revenue of $37.5 billion, which would indicate 70% year-over-year growth. Wall Street analysts are convinced that Nvidia undershot its revenue projection, as they estimate 73% growth on average. This is because Nvidia has a strong track record of exceeding expectations. In Q3, management expected $32.5 billion but generated $35.1 billion. For Q2, they expected $28 billion but generated $30 billion. Considering how much money has been spent on AI over the past quarter, I'd say that Nvidia likely exceeds that $37.5 billion mark they set for themselves. Nvidia's business has been so strong because of its best-in-class graphics processing units (GPUs) and software. GPUs have a distinct advantage over CPUs: They can process multiple calculations in parallel, resulting in far greater computing power. This effect can be amplified by combining thousands of GPUs in a cluster. While the AI computing hardware buildout was significant in 2023 and 2024, 2025 will represent another peak in AI hardware spending. Some of the biggest companies have indicated that a large chunk of the capital expenditures for 2025 will be dedicated to AI hardware, and these numbers are incredibly high. Meta Platforms plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures this year, and Alphabet plans to spend $75 billion. For reference, this is what the capital expenditures over a rolling 12-month period looked like for both companies. META Capital Expenditures (TTM) data by YCharts A huge chunk of money will be spent in 2025, and Nvidia is primed to benefit from that spending. However, the stock doesn't look like it has priced much of that in. Nvidia's stock is comparatively cheap to other big tech stocks Despite a promising 2025 ahead, Nvidia's stock really doesn't look all that expensive anymore. Story Continues NVDA PE Ratio data by YCharts At 52 times trailing earnings and 30 times forward earnings, it's priced pretty cheaply, considering that Wall Street analysts expect 52% revenue growth in fiscal year 2026. Now, let's compare Nvidia's growth prospects and valuation to some other big tech companies. AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts From a forward earnings perspective, Nvidia's stock is cheaper than Apple's and Microsoft's stock. If Nvidia can keep up any level of growth past 2025, then it looks like an absolute no-brainer at these prices. I'm confident that Nvidia will report strong Q4 results and likely exceed expectations. Considering the amount of money that its largest clients are planning on spending this year versus last year, 2025 also looks primed to be a phenomenal year for Nvidia. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock jumps to new all-time highs following the earnings report, which means investors must take advantage of the sale price before it's too late. Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now? Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years. Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $850,946!* Now, it’s worth noting Stock Advisor’s total average return is 959% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 178% for the S&P 500.

            "full_text": "For Immediate Release Chicago, IL – February 18, 2025 – Zacks Equity Research shares Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. CALM as the Bull of the Day and e.l.f. Beauty ELF as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on NVIDIA Corporation NVDA and BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. BBAI. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: Bull of the Day: Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. is selling a record number of eggs, thanks to the egg shortage. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has soaring earnings. But is it too late to buy the stock? Cal-Maine Foods is the largest producer and distributor of fresh shell eggs in the United States. It produces, grades, packages, and distributes fresh shell eggs, including conventional, cage-free, organic, brown, free-range, pasture-raised, and nutritionally enhanced eggs. Cal-Maine Foods Saw Record Egg Sales in the Fiscal Second Quarter of 2025 On Jan 7, 2025, Cal-Maine Foods reported its fiscal second quarter 2025 results. Net sales jumped to $954.7 million from $523.2 million the prior year due to an increase in net average selling price of shell eggs as well as an increase in total dozens sold. The average selling price per dozen rose to $2.74 from $1.73 the prior year due to the egg shortage which is the result of recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (\"HPAI\"), otherwise known as the bird flu. Additionally, feed cost fell 12.8% to $0.483 from $0.554 in fiscal 2024. It was nearly ideal conditions for Cal-Maine Foods as it also saw strong egg demand, especially ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. It sold 329.8 million dozens shell eggs, up from 288.2 million in the year ago period. Sales of conventional eggs were 209.6 million dozens, up 8.9% from 192.5 million last year. Specialty egg sales boomed, jumping 25% to 120.2 million dozens from 95.7 million dozens the prior year. Cal-Maine Makes Strategic Investments During the Egg Shortage As bird flu kills more chickens, and eggs remain in low supply but big demand, Cal-Maine continued to make strategic investments to expand its operations. As of Jan 7, 2025, it had about $60 million in new capital projects that would expand its cage-free capacity. The projects include the addition of five new cage-free layer houses and two pullet houses across the company's locations in Florida, Georgia, Utah, and Texas. When those projects are completed, Cal-Maine Foods expects capacity for about 1.1 million cage-free layer hens and 250,000 pullets by late summer 2025. It's also spending $15 million to expand its egg products processing facility in Blackshear, Georgia, to add extended shelf-life liquid egg products. Story Continues Cal-Maine Foods also expected that is processing plant and hatchery in Dexter, Missouri, will be online in the fiscal third quarter of 2025. Analyst Is Bullish on Cal-Maine Foods' Fiscal 2025 Earnings Zacks only has one earnings estimate on Cal-Maine Foods and it is for the full year. But that analyst was bullish thirty days ago, as the fiscal 2025 Zacks Consensus jumped to $15.59 from $8.54 during that time. That is earnings growth of 174% as it made $5.69 in fiscal 2024. Egg prices continue to rise as shortages continue. In calendar 2024, 38.4 million commercial layer hens and 1.8 million pullets were depopulated due to the bird flu. 2022 was the last time there was a big surge in egg prices. Cal-Maine Foods Paid Out a Big Variable Dividend in Feb 2025 Call-Maine Foods has a variable dividend policy which states that for each quarter in which the company reports net income, it pays a cash dividend to shareholders in an amount equal to one-third of such quarterly income. The fiscal second quarter dividend was $1.49 per share. It was payable on Feb 13, 2025 to holders of record as of Jan 29, 2025. Shares Soar Over the Last Year Cal-Maine Foods is in a cyclical industry. Investors have piled into the stock in the last year as egg prices have risen, and so have earnings and dividends. But it looks like some investors are taking gains off the table. The stock is cheap, with earnings at these levels. It trades at 7x. But when earnings fall again, the stock will not be as cheap. For investors looking for a way to invest in record egg prices, Cal-Maine Foods should be on your short list. Bear of the Day: e.l.f. Beauty recently warned about slowing sales in January 2025. As a result, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) lowered its fiscal full year 2025 guidance and shares sank. e.l.f. Beauty operates a beauty company with a mission to make the best of beauty accessible to every eye, lip, and face. Its brands include e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. SKIN, Keys Soulcare, Well People and Naturium. e.l.f. Beauty offers clean and vegan products. e.l.f. Beauty Misses on Earnings for the First Time Since 2021 On Feb 6, 2025, e.l.f. Beauty reported its fiscal third quarter 2025 earnings results. It missed on earnings for the first time since early 2021. Earnings were $0.74 compared to the Zacks Consensus of $0.76. Sales, however, rose 31% to $355.3 million, driven by strength in both the retailer and e-commerce channels, in both the U.S. and internationally. Gross margin increased again, rising 40 basis points to 71%, due to favorable foreign exchange impacts on goods purchased from China, cost savings and inventory adjustments, partially offset by mix and higher transportation costs. e.l.f. Beauty's CEO, Tarang Amin, said in the press release that e.l.f. gained 220 basis points of market share in the US in the quarter. e.l.f. Beauty Lowered Fiscal 2025 Earnings and Sales Guidance However, in a shock announcement, e.l.f. Beauty saw softer than expected trends in January, so it lowered its fourth quarter and full year guidance. It now expects 27-28% year-over-year net sales increase for the quarter, down from its prior guidance of 28-30%. Full year earnings guidance was also lowered to a range of $3.27 to $3.32 from the prior guidance of $3.47 to $3.53. As a result, the analysts have cut their fiscal 2025 estimates, but also their fiscal 2026 estimates, in the last 30 days. 13 estimates were cut for fiscal 2025, which pushed the Zacks Consensus down to $3.33 from $3.60 during the last month. That is earnings growth of just 4.7% over fiscal 2024 as the company made $3.18 last year. 13 estimates were also cut for fiscal 2026 after the earnings report. The 2026 Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen to $3.63 from $4.35 in that time. However, that's still earnings growth of 9.1%. Here's what it looks like on the price and consensus chart. The prior years saw strong earnings growth but now, the consensus is being cut. e.l.f. Beauty Shares Slide in the Last Year e.l.f. Beauty shares got slammed on the lowered guidance, but they had already been weak since July of 2024. They are down 54% in the last year but remain above the S&P 500's performance of the last 5 years. e.l.f. Beauty was one of the big growth stocks coming out of the pandemic. Investors bid the shares up to sky-high valuations with high price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples as they were willing to pay more for the growth. With the shares coming down, it now trades with a forward P/E of 21.9. That is still not a value stock, even though it's looking more attractive. Value stocks usually trade under 15x. Is the consumer permanently slowing down purchases with respect to beauty? Only time will tell. But investors might want to wait on the sidelines until e.l.f. Beauty's sales outlook improves. Additional content: Is BigBear.ai Stock the Next NVIDIA? With the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA Corporation experienced rapid business growth. Its shares have soared 85.8% in the past year. However, BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. recently became a Wall Street darling, with its shares surging a whopping 332.5% over the past year. BigBear.ai stock has more than doubled this year, now trading over $9 from $4 at the beginning of the year. Does this mean the company that offers AI-powered decision-intelligence solutions is a promising investment in the AI industry? Let's find out – 3 Reasons to Be Bullish on BBAI Stock BigBear.ai recently secured a contract with the Department of Defense for its Virtual Anticipation Network (\"VANE\"), leading to a rally in its shares. VANE will utilize machine learning and AI to predict and proactively address adversarial actions in complex settings, according to BigBear.ai. The government contract opens up more business opportunities for BigBear.ai in the long run. With the government poised to spend more on defense, BigBear.ai has immense growth potential. BigBear.ai was also awarded a Navy contract last month, opening doors for growth in other federal agencies. The change in CEO, in the meantime, has been a boon for BigBear.ai. Mandy Long has been replaced by Kevin McAleenan, who has increased access to the Trump administration and extensive experience with government agencies, helping BigBear.ai secure more government contracts. An outcome from a recent summit in Paris, meanwhile, provided BigBear.ai with a bullish momentum. Proceedings from the event showed that European leaders are inclined toward relaxing AI regulatory standards, benefiting BigBear.ai's EU presence. Should I Invest in BBAI Stock Now? Could it be the next NVIDIA? BigBear.ai winning new contracts vis-à-vis share price gains may tempt retail investors to buy the stock. However, BigBear.ai's financials don't justify such rapid growth in its stock price. BigBear.ai's revenues for the first nine months of 2024 were unchanged from the same period a year ago, while the company had to bear operating losses in the past three quarters and bore a hefty goodwill impairment charge. The business is far from breaking even, making the BBAI stock susceptible to corrections soon. BigBear.ai, anyhow, has a bad reputation for going through a boom-and-bust cycle. For instance, in 2023, a broader AI boom led by the success of ChatGPT helped the BBAI stock rally. However, the company couldn't sustain its revenue growth, and the BBAI stock fell in 2024. Rapid growth also leads to profit bookings, which adds to price declines. Hence, investors should adopt a wait-and-watch approach for better clarity about its prospects since BigBear.ai's growth has, time and again, been inconsistent, and the stock is subjected to immense volatility. The BigBear.ai stock is currently more volatile than the markets it trades in. It has a beta of 3.17. Therefore, it's too early to predict BigBear.ai as the next NVIDIA, given NVIDIA's solid financials, chip demand, and market dominance, which contribute to long-term growth for the semiconductor giant (read more: NVIDIA or Palantir: Which is the Better AI Stock to Buy Now?). NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas BigBear.ai has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.

            "full_text": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to modestly beat earnings expectations when it reports fiscal Q4 results on February 26, according to Bank of America (BofA). Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. However, analysts caution that the company's first-quarter outlook could face challenges. BofA analysts point to three key concerns: the transition to Blackwell chips, a decline in Hopper chip demand, and ongoing restrictions in China. These factors could create some near-term pressure, even if the company delivers strong results for the previous quarter. While Nvidia's stock could see some volatility after earnings, BofA remains optimistic about its long-term potential. The firm continues to back Nvidia as its top sector pick, emphasizing that it's not just a chipmaker but a full-fledged computing platform. A major advantage for Nvidia, according to BofA, is its ability to seamlessly integrate hardware and software, something that sets it apart in the fast-evolving AI market. BofA believes Nvidia's valuation remains attractive, trading at 31x projected 2025 earnings and 24x for 2026on the lower end of its historical 25x-56x price-to-earnings range. Looking ahead, analysts say Nvidia's upcoming GTC conference on March 17 could be a major catalyst. The company is expected to unveil its GB300 and Rubin chips and showcase expansion plans into robotics and quantum computing. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. View Comments"

            "full_text": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is reshaping the global economy at an unprecedented pace, with innovations emerging across every sector from healthcare to transportation. As companies race to integrate AI capabilities into products and services, investors are keenly searching for opportunities to capitalize on this technological transformation. After all, industry leaders like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang project that AI could generate up to $100 trillion in economic value -- a figure that would dwarf the impact of previous technological revolutions. The hype surrounding such noteworthy economic projections has caused scores of AI-related equities to soar over the past two years. Yet despite this remarkable appreciation, the AI investment landscape remains rich with opportunity. Image source: Getty Images. To help navigate the AI revolution, I've compiled a snapshot of 25 top players, ranging from established tech leaders to emerging entities across multiple industries. This overview of each company's core AI focus and market position can serve as a starting point for prospective AI investors looking for the best equities in the space. AI hardware players 1.

The company's first-mover advantage and extensive software ecosystem make it the de facto standard for AI computing. 2. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) challenges Nvidia's dominance with its MI300 AI accelerators. The company leverages strong relationships with cloud providers and a competitive price-to-performance ratio. 3. Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) aims to reclaim chip leadership through its AI-focused Gaudi processors and manufacturing investments, backed by deep enterprise relationships and substantial research and development (R&D) resources. 4. ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) holds a monopoly on the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines essential for manufacturing advanced AI chips, making it a critical infrastructure play in the AI revolution. 5. Wolfspeed (NYSE: WOLF) leads in silicon carbide semiconductor production, vital for power management in AI data centers and electric vehicles (EVs). 6. Navitas Corporation (NASDAQ: NVTS) specializes in gallium nitride power systems that enable more efficient AI hardware implementations, particularly in data centers and fast-charging applications. AI software and cloud infrastructure 7. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) leads in enterprise AI through its exclusive partnership with OpenAI, integrating GPT-4 technology across its cloud and software products while holding a significant stake in OpenAI. Story Continues 8. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) provides AI-powered cloud infrastructure and applications, with a focus on enterprise databases and business intelligence solutions. 9. C3.ai (NYSE: AI) provides ready-to-deploy enterprise AI applications across industries, with a focus on predictive analytics and process optimization. 10.

Kratos Defense & Security Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: KTOS) develops AI-enabled autonomous systems and combat drones, positioning itself at the intersection of AI and military modernization. Tech giants and integrated AI 20. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) integrates AI across its device ecosystem while developing Apple Intelligence, its generative AI initiative, along with specialized AI chips focusing on on-device machine learning and privacy-preserving AI applications. 21. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) deploys AI across search, cloud services, and research divisions while generating significant revenue from AI-powered advertising and enterprise solutions. 22.

Serve Robotics (NASDAQ: SERV) targets the autonomous delivery market with AI-powered robots, offering a pure-play investment in the automation of last-mile logistics. Key takeaways Success in AI investing requires understanding how companies monetize the technology. Semiconductor manufacturers generate revenue from AI chips and infrastructure, while software companies must convert AI capabilities into sustainable revenue streams. Tech giants leverage AI to enhance existing profit centers, and emerging players seek to disrupt traditional industries. The AI market's rapid evolution favors companies with strong intellectual property, proven revenue models, and the resources to maintain competitive advantages. While market enthusiasm has driven up valuations across the AI space, selective investments in companies with clear paths to profitability and defensible market positions could handsomely reward patient investors.

            "full_text": "ASML Holding N.V. ASML has been on an upward trajectory in 2025, gaining 8.5% year to date despite broader market volatility. The stock has outperformed both the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 index, reflecting strong investor confidence. It has also outshined semiconductor heavyweights like NVIDIA NVDA, Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL. YTD Price Return Performance Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research While ASML’s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing equipment remains unchallenged, near-term risks such as export restrictions and premium valuation suggest that holding the stock is the best strategy for now. ASML’s Strong Technology Leadership ASML’s dominance in the semiconductor manufacturing sector is unchallenged. The company holds a near-monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the cutting-edge technology that is essential for producing the most advanced chips. This technology enables the semiconductor industry to continue progressing to smaller, more powerful nodes, such as 3nm and below. Although the high cost of EUV machines limits the pool of customers, ASML’s leadership ensures that it remains the go-to provider for major semiconductor manufacturers, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, aka TSMC, Samsung and Intel. ASML’s investment in next-generation technologies, such as High-NA EUV, signals that the company is preparing for the future. High-NA EUV systems, designed for even smaller nodes, are expected to be essential for the semiconductor industry’s continued evolution. While the adoption of the high-NA EUV technology has been slower than anticipated, the long-term growth potential remains significant. ASML is positioning itself as a key enabler of the semiconductor industry’s future, which supports a favorable investment thesis for those with a long-term view. ASML’s Solid Financials Despite Market Volatility ASML’s recently reported financial results for the fourth quarter of 2024 showcased remarkable growth, with net sales climbing 24% year over year to €9.26 billion and net income rising approximately 30% to €2.69 billion. Earnings per share also grew 30% to €6.85, reflecting solid operational efficiency. The gross margin expanded 90 basis points year over year to 51.7%, reflecting strong cost management and improved efficiency in its advanced lithography systems. ASML’s guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2025 indicates continued growth momentum in the near term. The midpoint of the revenue guidance for the first quarter and full-year signifies year-over-year growth of 46.5% and 15%, respectively. The midpoint of the gross margin forecast indicates an improvement of 150 basis points for the first quarter and 70 basis points for 2025. Story Continues Order Backlog Remains a Key Strength for ASML A major strength for ASML is its record backlog of €36 billion, which provides strong visibility into future revenues. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the company booked €7.1 billion in new orders, including €3 billion from EUV machines and €4.1 billion from deep ultraviolet (DUV) sales. While semiconductor capital expenditures have softened, AI-driven demand for high-performance computing (HPC) chips, high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced data center processors continues to fuel interest in ASML’s lithography tools. As chipmakers expand their 2nm and sub-2nm production capabilities, ASML’s next-generation EUV systems will remain critical, securing long-term revenue streams. Near-Term Challenges Persist for ASML One of ASML’s most pressing challenges is increasing geopolitical risk, particularly export restrictions on semiconductor equipment to China. The Dutch government, under U.S. pressure, has imposed strict limits on ASML’s ability to sell its most advanced lithography tools to Chinese customers, impacting potential revenue growth from one of its largest markets. China accounted for about 41% of ASML’s lithography shipments in 2024, meaning any additional trade restrictions could further reduce sales opportunities. With U.S.-China tensions escalating, the risk of retaliatory measures affecting ASML’s supply chain or customer relationships cannot be ignored. Although ASML remains resilient and diversified across global markets, these geopolitical uncertainties could lead to short-term stock price volatility. ASML Holding N.V. Image Source: ASML Holding N.V. Meanwhile, macroeconomic challenges such as inflation, a sluggish recovery in mobile and PC markets, and delays in the memory segment’s rebound compound ASML’s woes. These factors highlight the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, which is still contending with post-pandemic demand volatility. ASML Premium Valuation: A Reason for Concern ASML stock currently trades at a premium to the Zacks Computer and Technology sector. Its forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.22 exceeds the sector’s average of 26.19. While this premium reflects ASML’s technological edge and market leadership, it also limits the stock’s immediate upside potential. Forward 12-Month P/E Ratio Zacks Investment Research Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Conclusion: Hold ASML Stock for Now ASML’s technological leadership, strong financials and robust backlog make it a high-quality long-term investment. However, geopolitical risks, a slower investment cycle and a premium valuation suggest that immediate upside is limited. Investors should hold ASML stock for now, watching for potential pullbacks or signs of accelerating demand before increasing exposure. Currently, ASML carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

            "ticker": "NVDA",
            "full_text": "Nvidia shares moved higher in early Tuesday trading and look set to return to levels reached prior to the emergence of China-based DeepSeek in late January, as investors picked through details of the latest tweaks in its nascent tech portfolio. Nvidia  (NVDA)  which holds the market's dominant position in AI chipmaking making under CEO Jensen Huang, also runs a small portfolio of investments that, under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, require quarterly public updates normally reserved for hedge funds and large investment vehicles. In the group's latest 13-F filing, published on the SEC website Friday, Nvidia noted a big change in its stake in Arm Holdings, the U.K.-based chip designer it attempted to buy outright for $40 billion in 2020. Nvidia owned around 1.1 million shares in the group at the end of last year, its 13-F filing indicated, a 44% reduction from its prior report at the end of the third quarter of last year. The current value of its holding was pegged at around $181 million. The emergence of China-based DeepSeek, an cut-pried AI chatbot, triggered a record $593 billion plunge in Nvidia shares last month. Bloomberg/Getty Images Nvidia called off its attempted purchase of Arm three years ago, citing pressure from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, as well as in China, over the impact of the deal on global competition. “Arm has a bright future, and we’ll continue to support them as a proud licensee for decades to come,” Huang said at the time. “Arm is at the center of the important dynamics in computing. Though we won’t be one company, we will partner closely with Arm.\" The latest move, however, could reflect Arm's reported interest in expanding its business, which at present centers around licensing intellectual property for chip designs, to a more proactive approach that could involve designing and selling its own line of processors. Nvidia slashes Arm stake Reuters reported last week that Arm is accelerating that effort, aiming to compete directly against some of its own licensing customers, which include Nvidia, Apple  (AAPL) , and Qualcomm  (QCOM) . JPMorgan analyst Harland Sur, in a note published last week, said that the planned investment by Arm's biggest shareholder, Japan-based SoftBank, in the U.S. AI venture Stargate could eventually lead it into direct competition with Nvidia. Related: An AI giant poses a new threat to Nvidia The analyst noted, however, that Broadcom  (AVGO)  is likely to be the biggest beneficiary, given its market leadership in custom AI chips, a lower-priced and highly efficient alternative to Nvidia's powerhouse GPUs. “With the stepped-up focus on compute efficiency (thanks to DeepSeek), we can see these AI ASIC programs being accelerated to further augment compute efficiency and drive a more aggressive cost/compute curve,\" Harland wrote. Story Continues Nvidia also unveiled a new 1.7 million share stake in China-based WeRide, a client that uses the chipmaker's software and lower-end GPUs to power its autonomous vehicles. Nebius Group, an AI-focused tech group rebranded from Russia's Yandex, was also listed as a new Nvidia investment with a 1.2 million share stake value at around $33 million. Shares of the Amsterdam-based group trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol NBIS. Sound Cloud, Serve Robotics out Interestingly, Nvidia also closed out prior holdings in SoundCloud  (SOUN) , which it unveiled in its maiden 13-F filing last year, and Redwood, Calif.-based robot delivery group Serve Robotics. Nvidia will post its fourth-quarter earnings after the close of trading on February 26, with analysts looking for overall revenues to rise around 66% to $24.5 billion and net income surging 62% to $20.85 billion.

It offers unique investment opportunities and is the first of its kind. It pairs bullish bets on innovative companies with bearish ones on their traditional industry counterparts. ELON in Focus Battleshares TSLA vs. F ETF seeks long-term capital appreciation. It is designed to capitalize on the competitive dynamics within the automobile industry by taking targeted positions in two specific companies, one which the advisor views as a new leader in this industry —Tesla TSLA — and one which the advisor views as a legacy leader in this industry — Ford Motor F (read: Tesla Misses on Q4 Earnings, Vows to Return to Growth: ETFs to Buy).The new ETF employs a unique investment strategy by establishing a leveraged long position in Tesla, offering investors 200% of the stock's upside while simultaneously holding a short position in Ford, targeting around 100% of the fund's net assets. This means that ELON will benefit if TSLA’s share price outperforms F’s share price after considering the effects of leverage. The new ETF comes with a hefty expense ratio of 1.29%. How Will It Fit in a Portfolio? The ETF could be an intriguing choice for investors seeking exposure to the ongoing transformation within the automotive sector, aiming to benefit from the divergence between innovation and tradition. The ETF's long/short structure is particularly suited for investors who are bullish on Tesla's growth prospects and bearish on Ford's performance. This positioning allows potential gains from Tesla's upward momentum while hedging against potential declines in traditional automakers like Ford.However, it's essential to recognize that ELON's leveraged positions amplify both potential gains and losses, introducing a higher level of risk and volatility. Therefore, this ETF may be more appropriate for investors with a higher risk tolerance and a strong conviction in the underlying investment thesis. Additionally, due to its concentrated exposure, ELON should be considered as a complement to a well-diversified portfolio rather than a core holding (read: 5 Leveraged ETFs That Witnessed Double-Digit Gains in January). ETF Competition The concept of pairing long positions in innovative companies with short positions in their traditional counterparts is relatively novel in the ETF space. While there are existing leveraged single-stock ETFs that allow investors to bet on individual companies' stock movements, ELON is among the first to combine two different stocks with opposing directional bets within a single product. This innovative approach sets it apart from traditional ETFs that focus solely on long positions or broader market indices. Defiance ETFs has indicated plans to expand the Battleshares lineup with similar pairings, potentially including matchups like NVIDIA NVDA vs. Intel (INTC), Coinbase COIN vs. Wells Fargo (WFC) and Amazon AMZN vs. Macy's (M). These forthcoming ETFs aim to provide investors with opportunities to capitalize on competitive market dynamics across various industries. Story Continues Bottom Line The launch of ELON ETF offers a unique investment vehicle for those looking to engage in the evolving competition between disruptive innovators and established industry players.

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 10.5% in the afternoon session after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is in talks with Broadcom and TSMC to sell certain assets. Sources revealed Broadcom is interested in Intel's product business, while TSMC is more focused on snapping up and controlling some of its factories. Investors are betting on management to make a move to unlock value in some of its operating segments, given the significant investments that have been made in recent years. The stock's reaction suggests the market sees real potential in a deal with industry peers like Broadcom and TSMC, both leaders in chip design and manufacturing. Is now the time to buy Intel? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Intel’s shares are very volatile and have had 23 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Intel and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 8.7% on the news that Vice President JD Vance announced at the AI Action Summit in Paris that the US will provide regulatory measures to protect the country's artificial intelligence technologies from \"theft and misuse.\" The global AI race is intensifying across industries, but few are as critical as semiconductors, where AI-powered chips run smart data centers, large language models like ChatGPT, and self-driving cars. Intel has recently won government grants to build facilities to manufacture cutting-edge semiconductor chips on US soil in the coming years, a move that could help improve the company's competitiveness. The Vice President's comments suggest Intel and other US innovators could benefit from measures that help protect valuable intellectual property, especially in artificial intelligence, ensuring their innovations drive sales and expand market share both domestically and internationally. Intel is up 28.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $26.04 per share, it is still trading 43.6% below its 52-week high of $46.15 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $393.76. Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.

The Wall Street Journal reported late Saturday that Broadcom (AVGO) is considering making a bid for Intel's product business, which designs semiconductors for computers and servers. The Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter, said TSMC has looked at controlling some or all of Intel's factories, potentially as part of an investor consortium.

NasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price • USD (INTC) Follow View Quote Details 26.69 - +(13.09%) As of 2:48:56 PM EST. Market Open. INTC AVGO TSM Advanced Chart Intel stock has been on a tear over the past week. The stock notched its biggest weekly gain since 2000 last Friday as the US signaled support for domestic chipmaking and reports surfaced that the US government was working with TSMC to support Intel's turnaround efforts. Intel's manufacturing business primarily makes chips for itself (Intel's product business) but opened up a foundry — in other words, began taking on external customers — in 2022 under the leadership of then-CEO Pat Gelsinger. Gelsinger had pushed to launch a foundry business competitive with Taiwan's TSMC in an attempt to right Intel's struggling manufacturing division, which had suffered from setbacks since the mid-2010s. The turnaround effort has not been successful to date, given that Intel's manufacturing business has struggled to take on outside customers and continues to bleed cash. Intel's earnings disappointed investors throughout 2024, and the stock fell around 60% last year. Gelsinger was ousted by Intel's board in December. The company has become an acquisition target, and the interest from Broadcom and TSMC follows reports of potential takeovers by Qualcomm (QCOM), Arm (ARM), and Apollo last year. Wall Street analysts have favored Intel splitting its business into two. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to investors Monday: \"In our view, splitting Intel Product and Foundry is the key to unlocking value.\" The symbol for Intel appears on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, on Oct. 1, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) · ASSOCIATED PRESS Intel announced plans last year to establish an independent subsidiary for its foundry business, separating its finances and operations from its products division. Analysts viewed the move as the company paving the way for a potential split, though Intel's US CHIPS Act funding limits its ability to fully sell its manufacturing business.

            "full_text": "Intel - Photo: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg (Getty Images) Intel (INTC) stock was rising sharply on Tuesday morning as investors weighed the benefits of reported plans that could see rivals acquire parts of its business. One plan could see Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is already responsible for about 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors, acquire Intel’s manufacturing business, The New York Times reported. It could also take a majority stake in the business alongside a group of private equity and tech companies. That idea has been pushed by President Donald Trump’s administration and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to be Commerce Secretary. Frank Yeary, Intel’s interim executive chair, has met with both TSMC (TSM) and Trump administration officials about the deal, The Times reported. While the Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the White House is unlikely to support a deal that would let a foreign entity operate Intel’s factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. Broadcom (AVGO) has also been examining Intel’s chip design and manufacturing business, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The deal, which Broadcom executives have only informally discussed, would hinge on finding a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing business, The Journal reported. Nothing has been submitted to Intel yet. Qualcomm (QCOM) has also been interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Yeary has left the door open for other companies interested in buying Intel’s product business, including Qualcomm, The Times reported. Intel stock surged 10% in Tuesday morning trading. The stock has rallied to start the year. The potential deals come a few months after Intel ousted its former CEO, who failed to help modernize and stabilize the tech giant, which has struggled to compete with rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA) and TSMC. The company has also hired help to fend off potential activist investors. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025 through measures including a 15% reduction of its workforce. The following month, the company said it would further separate its chip-manufacturing and design operations, and pause factory projects in Germany, Poland, and Malaysia. Despite its issues, Intel said last month that it expects to report break-even profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting declining revenue for three periods in a row. In November, the company was awarded a $7.86 billion grant by then-President Joe Biden’s administration to build semiconductors in the U.S. The Trump administration is expected to rely on Intel to make domestic chips, at least as long as TSMC declines to move operations to the U.S. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "full_text": "Investing.com -- Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s recent 20% stock rally, driven by speculation about a potential partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM), may be based on \"wishful thinking,\" according to Lynx Equity Strategy analyst KC Rajkumar. The analyst suggests fading the rally, citing both business and geopolitical challenges surrounding Intel Foundry Services (IFS). \"Why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel's IFS?\" Rajkumar asks, highlighting TSMC's previously stated reluctance to operate overseas due to higher costs and limited local talent. He also points to IFS's \"questionable performance at advanced nodes\" and its ongoing losses, with Intel's CFO projecting a breakeven point no earlier than late 2027. The analyst questions the strategic logic of TSMC investing in Intel's foundry business, particularly when global capacity at both leading and lagging nodes is no longer constrained. Rajkumar also flags concerns around IFS's opaque relationship with external asset management firms and its \"tortured relationship\" with the US government via the CHIPS Act. Beyond the business fundamentals, geopolitical dynamics add another layer of complexity. Rajkumar notes that potential \"coercion, via threat of tariffs on semis imports,\" could be a factor pushing TSMC toward the negotiation table. However, media reports on direct discussions between TSMC and the US government are \"of questionable credibility,\" he adds, given that such matters typically require state-to-state engagement through Taiwan's government. Rajkumar also points to recent developments in US-Taiwan relations as a potential backdrop for the Intel-TSMC speculation. The US State Department recently updated its website, removing language that explicitly stated opposition to Taiwan's independence. \"We think the two are connected,\" Rajkumar writes, suggesting that Washington might be seeking an “acceptable mechanism” to talk with the Taiwan government, and by extension, TSM. However, the geopolitical calculus remains fraught, particularly given the likely reaction from China. \"What may have been a simple matter of negotiation between two private companies, INTC and TSM, could get hopelessly entangled in geopolitical intrigue,\" Rajkumar cautions. Ultimately, both business and geopolitical factors leave the analyst unconvinced about the deal's prospects. \"We struggle to understand if there is a future to an IFS/TSM relationship,\" Rajkumar concludes. \"We would fade the 20+% move up in INTC last week.

            "full_text": "The Intel booth at the Tokyo Game Show on September 21, 2023 in Chiba, Japan. - Photo: Tomohiro Ohsumi (Getty Images) Chip pioneer Intel (INTC) could see its faltering business be split up by its rivals. The chipmaker has become an acquisition target for its competitors amid recent struggles to compete for dominance in artificial intelligence chips. The company, which rose to prominence with its central processing chips for personal computers and data centers, announced in August that it was laying off more than 15% of employees as part of a plan to reduce capital expenditures by more than $10 billion this year. Intel was reported in August to be working with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) on options to fix its business, including by splitting its foundry division (which designs and manufactures chips), cutting factory projects, and mergers and acquisitions, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (QCOM), which designs smartphone chips, was interested in buying parts of Intel’s business, Reuters reported in September. Now, the chipmaker is reportedly facing separate potential deals that could split its business in two. Broadcom (AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) (TSMC) are interested in Intel’s chip design and manufacturing businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Intel’s shares climbed by 10% on Tuesday morning after the report, and is up by almost 30% so far this year. However, the chipmaker’s stock is down by more than 40% year over year. TSMC declined to comment. Neither Intel nor Broadcom immediately responded to requests for comment. Here’s what to know about the potential deals that could leave Intel split in two. What does Broadcom want? Broadcom, which designs and develops chips used in smartphones and data centers, is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit. The company has held informal discussions about making a bid with its advisors, but likely won’t follow through unless it finds a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing side, people told the Wall Street Journal. The chipmaker has not made an offer, and could decide not to bid, the Wall Street Journal reported. What does TSMC want? TSMC is reportedly interested in Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. The Taiwanese chipmaker could potentially join an investor consortium or find another way to control some or all of the factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Trump administration reportedly asked TSMC to consider taking over Intel’s chip plants, but a White House spokesperson told Quartz that President Donald Trump is unlikely to support a non-U.S. company operating the foundry. Story Continues Frank Yeary, the interim executive chairman of Intel, has discussed a deal with Trump administration officials and TSMC executives to separate Intel’s manufacturing business, the New York Times reported. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has reportedly been involved in the discussions. The U.S. government would have to sign off on a deal between TSMC and Intel. The Taiwanese chipmaker could also face challenges from the Trump administration’s restrictions on immigration, considering that a large part of its engineering team is from Taiwan and other places abroad, people told the Wall Street Journal. Both Intel and TSMC received funding from the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which was focused on boosting semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development in the U.S. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

            "full_text": "Feb 18 - Intel (INTC, Financial) jumped more than 10% on Tuesday morning after new reports revealed that the chipmaker is under fresh acquisition talks. Sources indicate that Broadcom (AVGO, Financial) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) are in the early stages of evaluating bids that could split Intel's core businesses. Broadcom appears interested in Intel's chip design division, while TSM eyes the manufacturing segment, although retooling Intel's factories to meet TSM's production methods could prove costly. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with INTC. This development comes after a turbulent year 2024 in which Intel shares plunged nearly 60% and CEO Pat Gelsinger departed following a sluggish turnaround. Buying rumors were enough to lift Intel's stock higher this past week, and the momentum appears to continue after trading resumes following the President's Day holiday. Such potential deals are seen by analysts as a critical chance for Intel to reshape and win back the trust of investors. However, they also warn that the process of integration may be filled with big obstacles. The semiconductor giant is on the brink of a critical juncture of structural change that can completely change its business model. Now, investors and market scrutinizers are looking closely as the negotiations move forward, knowing full well that whatever deal is made will reflect complex adjustments and regulatory review in a way that may touch almost all elements of the tech world.

            "ticker": "INTC",
            "full_text": "Shares of chip-giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have been obliterated over the past few years. Unfortunately, years of mismanagement and complacency opened the door for TSMC to take the lead in semiconductor manufacturing and AMD to stage an epic comeback. Intel still leads the market for PC and server central processing units (CPUs), but its dominance has been severely eroded. Intel's attempted turnaround effort, led by former CEO Pat Gelsinger, is now in flux after Gelsinger's surprise retirement in late 2024. As Intel searches for a new CEO and a new strategy, the company is fighting on two fronts. First, Intel is charging ahead with its foundry investments, with plans to bring its advanced Intel 18A process to volume production later this year. Second, the company is attempting to stabilize its CPU market share with new products. There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty surrounding Intel stock right now, but the picture should be much clearer in 2026. Clarity on the foundry effort Intel has invested heavily in new manufacturing facilities and equipment as part of an audacious plan to challenge TSMC in the foundry market. The final process node in the company's original foundry roadmap, Intel 18A, is set to go into volume production later this year. The fate of Intel's foundry business rests on Intel 18A. The company has scored some major customers for the process, including Microsoft and Amazon, but it's going to need a steady stream of additional customer wins for these foundry investments to pay off. Intel also plans to use Intel 18A for its own products, so the process will need to be competitive for the company's product segment to thrive. By this time next year, it should be clearer whether Intel 18A can turn the foundry business into a major success. A mixed bag in the product business In the PC CPU business, Intel is struggling to put out desktop chips that can compete with AMD. Intel's latest Arrow Lake CPUs are solid performers, in general, but fall flat in gaming workloads. Its previous Raptor Lake chips are powerful, but also power-hungry and prone to instability issues. The good news for Intel is that its laptop CPUs are far more competitive. Early reviews of the company's Arrow Lake laptop chips have been exceptionally positive, with the chips providing best-in-class performance and great battery life. Arrow Lake should help Intel reclaim some market share, and the Intel 18A-based Panther Lake can build on those gains later this year. In the server CPU market, Intel is getting aggressive. The company's Granite Rapids CPUs are powerful and have largely closed the performance gap with AMD, but Intel initially priced them well above the competition. The company recently lowered list prices dramatically for Granite Rapids, a potential sign that it's willing to sacrifice margins to go after market share. Story Continues New server CPUs aren't coming until 2026, so Granite Rapids and the efficiency-focused Sierra Forest will be what Intel has to work with as it tries to claw back lost market share. High risk, high reward Intel stock could go nowhere over the next year if the company fails to make progress winning back market share or if Intel 18A doesn't begin to bring in more foundry customers. However, given how far Intel stock has fallen, it won't take much good news to send shares soaring. In particular, if Intel 18A enables Intel to launch PC chips that handily beat the competition, it would be a win for both the product and foundry businesses. In 2026, Intel could then build on that momentum with its first server CPUs built on the Intel 18A process. There's also a chance that Intel will spin off its foundry business over the next year. Given that the foundry will consume a lot of capital as it marches toward profitability over the next few years, which is currently provided by the product business, a spin-off looks unlikely. But you never know. Given the market sentiment around Intel right now, a spin-off would probably drive the stock higher, at least in the short term. Some sort of acquisition that splits up the company is also a possibility. A lot is going to change for Intel in 2025. The company will get a new CEO, set course on a new strategy, and complete its initial foundry roadmap. With the stock trading below book value -- an incredibly pessimistic valuation -- Intel stock has the potential to soar if the company's results begin to improve.

            "full_text": "The rumor mill is spinning overtime on struggling Intel (INTC) as the tech icon looks at ways to create shareholder value. Chip rivals Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) are each eyeing deals with Intel that could break up the company, the Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend. Broadcom is reportedly looking to gain control of Intel's lucrative chip design and marketing business. Taiwan Semiconductor is reportedly studying controlling some or all of Intel's chipmaking plants. A spokesperson for Intel didn't immediately return Yahoo Finance's request for comment. A breakup could extract a good bit of value for long-suffering Intel shareholders, Evercore analyst Mark Lipacis estimated. In an analysis of Intel's business, Lipacis said Intel is conservatively worth $167 billion or $38.24 a share. Intel's stock closed on Friday at $23.60, down roughly 50% over the past year. The stock has crashed 65% in the past five years to a market cap of $102 billion. Using more robust projections of financial performance for each business, Lipacis estimates Intel could be worth $237 billion or $54.18 a share. A path to a deal could be tough, Lipacis said. \"Depending on how a deal is structured, it might require regulatory approval from countries around the world, including China. Also, Intel has historically designed its factories to make x86 CPUs, so it is not clear if Intel's factories would be able to make external chips efficiently with its current physical plant. Finally, Intel's foundry business reported a 76% operating loss in 2024, vs Taiwan Semiconductor's 45% operating margin,\" he explained. Wall Street analysts at Raymond James, Bank of America, and Bernstein echoed concerns over regulatory hurdles and antitrust issues, with Bank of America’s Vivek Arya saying that \"any potential INTC split could be time-consuming and complicated.\" Plus, any deal involving TSMC and Intel's manufacturing business would face tight constraints given the rules of Intel's CHIPS Act funding, which requires Intel to retain ownership of more than 50% of its foundry, Arya wrote in a note to investors Tuesday morning. The Trump administration \"could be wary of a foreign entity completely taking over an iconic US-firm that has deep involvement with US Department of Defense customers,\" Arya wrote. Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri said in a note, \"[A] better outcome for [the] U.S. government would be to work with TSM separately to expand its U.S. manufacturing footprint.\" Story Continues Intel was awarded $3 billion in US government funding in September to manufacture chips for the military. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Broadcom would be a good candidate to take over Intel's products business. \"Hock [Tan] has shown the ability to take a hatchet to costs, ruthlessly, while still preserving innovation,\" Rasgon wrote of Broadcom's CEO in a note Tuesday morning. Intel store at Promenade Street in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, 2025. (Ömer Sercan Karku/Anadolu via Getty Images) · Anadolu via Getty Images Intel has endured a challenging few months. The tech icon parted ways with embattled CEO Pat Gelsinger on Dec. 1. Gelsinger led aggressive efforts to turn around the troubled US chipmaker for more than three years. He slashed thousands of jobs, improved costs, secured CHIPS Act funding, built chip foundries, and promised fast AI chips that could compete with Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD). Intel named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as the interim co-CEOs. Holthaus was also named Intel Products CEO. Intel will likely fill the CEO role by bringing in a top name from outside the company, Wall Street sources have told Yahoo Finance since Gelsinger's departure. Any permanent CEO will have to repair trust with investors after missing financial targets and make a decision on the foundry business. It also requires immediately stabilizing the financials. That's in addition to likely exploring a breakup of the company to drive shareholder value. Intel's fourth quarter sales fell 7% year over year to $14.3 billion. Net earnings plunged 76%. The company forecasts it will only break even on the profit line this year. Whatever happens to Intel, it will be important for the US. \"Well, it'd be great for the United States if their process, technology arm could be a credible alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. They're trying to do that, but that takes time and a lot of capital, so that is a very, very hard thing,\" Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).

While recent market concerns over whether AMD might have too much CPU inventory in the PC market have prompted benchmark analysts to take a more cautious tone on the market direction, they still say they see them in a better position than Intel. Rasgon attributes the consumption of CPUs above the market expansion of PCs by 13%, meaning that market saturation potential matters.

            "full_text": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other AI stocks. With the first quarter of 2025 well underway, Jim Cramer hasn't been short of comments on artificial intelligence. AI stocks, which entered 2025 with optimism and tailwinds were dealt a shock during January's DeepSeek selloff. The selloff was centered around stocks of firms that investors believe stand to benefit from billions of dollars in AI GPU spending. The firm that led the DeepSeek selloff was the AI GPU stock that has been Wall Street's favorite. Its shares dropped by 17% during the day and are flat year to date after having gained 17% since the selloff. Cramer has also been one of the firm's biggest fans. For instance, consider his remarks made in January before the selloff. Cramer started out by bemoaning a lack of knowledge about the firm and shared: \"Okay, some of the analysts are good, but some of the analysts are just talking about the quarter! And these are people, who are, they are bound by the four walls of idiocy. This is one of the greatest companies in the world, these people want to buy sell, buy sell, they don't recognize that [the firm] is doing things that are just running circles around.\" In fact, Cramer went as far as to suggest that the firm was ushering in an industrial revolution. According to him: \"Industrial revolution, why can't we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn't get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\" However, the CNBC TV show host had to naturally adjust his expectations after investors re-calibrated their AI GPU spending. Appearing on Squawk on the Street the day after the selloff, he shared two factors that would be key in determining the future of AI stock performance. According to Cramer, these factors are energy spending and GPU orders. Investors have focused on energy stocks, particularly those that deal with nuclear energy -  a fact that has sent some stocks to gain as much as 140% over the past year. As for GPU orders, the Q4 2024 earnings season has seen big tech firms persist in their multi-billion dollar AI capital expenditure commitments. Story Continues In another morning appearance, Cramer also commented on an outfit he had discovered that was better than DeepSeek. He shared: “Now there’s an outfit that I’ve been dealing with called you dot com. . . .I really like you dot com. It’s one of those companies that is really ahead of DeepSeek, it’s way ahead.\" He added that after digging deeper, he found that the AI GPU firm mentioned above was actually this outfit's largest investor. The investment signaled to Cramer that there are alternatives better than DeepSeek as he commented that \"the long knives came out\" for it at the slightest hint of trouble. Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.

A closeup of a woman's hands typing rapidly on a laptop in a corporate office setting. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 56 Date of Cramer’s Comments: September 10th, 2024 Performance Since Then: 27% International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is an enterprise computing and software company that provides businesses with cloud environments to run their workloads.  Its shares have gained 27% since Cramer's September comments. However, the stock would have been in the red had International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s shares not risen by 13% in late January. The shares rose primarily because of AI, as the firm's Q4 results revealed that its AI book had grown by $2 billion in just a quarter. Here's what Cramer had said about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) in September: \"International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) is doing quite well. We're playing around with Watson for ESPN, which is unbelievable. I'm getting more and more impressed. Arvind Krishna has reinvented the company. He's doing a terrific job.\" Overall IBM ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Musk touts that xAI's chatbot surpasses OpenAI and other competitors in multiple benchmarks. Lead Edge Capital founder Mitchell Green joins Catalysts to discuss the implications of these developments, noting that the AI race will intensify in the coming years. \"I think you're going to see over the next 6, 12, 18, 24 months lots of people continue to show that their models are faster and faster. As you saw in DeepSeek, you'll see that things get cheaper and cheaper,\" Green says. Green emphasizes that while Big Tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) will likely dominate due to their massive investments, older companies such as Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM) could emerge as AI winners. However, he cautions that the rapid pace of investment could lead to overbuilding. \"People tend to overestimate technological change in the near term, but they always tend to underestimate it in the long term. And, then of course, spending kind of goes the same way\" Green concludes.

            "full_text": "(Bloomberg) -- While many of the biggest and most popular technology stocks have stumbled out of the gates in 2025, some of the sector’s legacy names are drawing renewed attention. Most Read from Bloomberg Why Barcelona Bought the Building That Symbolizes Its Housing Crisis Por qué Barcelona compró el edificio que simboliza su crisis inmobiliaria Trump Child Refugee Agency Shares Data With Immigration Enforcers A Filmmaker’s Surreal Journey Into His Own Private Winnipeg NYC Restaurants Are Still Waiting for Their Outdoor Dining Plans to Be Approved Companies like Cisco Systems Inc., International Business Machines Corp., and Oracle Corp. are outperforming this year, as they signal that they, too, can be winners in the crucial growth area of artificial intelligence. These stocks are also attracting investors with cheaper valuations and appealing dividend yields compared with the more familiar AI winners, who are left with higher bars to clear after prolonged outperformance. A murky outlook for interest rates and import tariff tensions only underscore their appeal. “In a time of economic uncertainty, these more mature companies offer attributes that are defensive and very desirable,” said Stephen Bersey, head of technology research at HSBC. “At the same time, there is more AI-related demand, which is helping to boost their growth, which had otherwise been more diminished.” Take Cisco. The seller of networking gear had become something of an afterthought in the current tech landscape, with shares still well below their dot-com era peak. However, its results last week beat expectations, and it gave an outlook that showed strong demand related to the building of AI infrastructure. The news sparked a rally that took shares to their highest since 2000. Compared with the Magnificent Seven group of tech megacaps, the sector’s legacy names have lagged behind in the S&P 500’s AI-powered advance to multiple record highs. Recent trends have been more positive. Cisco is up 10% this year, including Tuesday’s gain of 1%, while IBM has rallied 19% and Oracle has risen 5.9%. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index is up 2%, while Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., and Tesla Inc. are all negative on the year. Nvidia Corp., the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, is up 6.2%. Rediscovering an old favorite like Cisco has emerged as something of an investment theme on Wall Street. IBM, another stock that went years between records, has charged higher in recent months. Its own forecast last month projected strong revenue growth and a jump in AI-related bookings, and it followed that up with a bullish long-term sales outlook. Story Continues “It was very unloved — then started hitting numbers, buying software and showed it is likely to grow 5%+,” wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes. Oracle has a similar new lease on life, with investors viewing it as a major player in cloud computing, alongside much-bigger peers like Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet. Results from the Magnificent Seven largely failed to reassure investors that their heavy spending on AI will deliver a major earnings boost any time soon. While Wall Street remains widely bullish on the group and its long-term potential with AI, current levels of spending and growth have made it harder to justify valuations, which in many cases are above their long-term averages. The legacy tech stocks, in contrast, look like bargains. Cisco trades at less than 17 times estimated earnings, compared with the Mag 7 index’s multiple above 30. Furthermore, Cisco and IBM offer indicated dividend yields above 2.5%, unusually high for tech companies. Cisco’s lower multiple reflects how, even with last week’s report, growth trends remain fairly underwhelming. Revenue is seen rising 4.8% in its 2025 fiscal year before slightly accelerating to 5% in fiscal 2026, a rate that represents a near-term peak, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That growth is half of what’s expected for the overall tech sector in both years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Still, the lower multiple could offer a buffer against macro uncertainties, including inflation, geopolitical tensions, and the prospect of a trade war, especially if there are additional signs their AI stories are only getting started. “I think these cheaper, more diversified tech companies, after having been overshadowed by the Mag 7, will continue to take the lead,” said Ted Parrish, chief investment officer of Parrish Capital. “They have stability in earnings but are a way to play AI that’s safer while the others are priced for perfection. They may be boring in some respects, but we think they’re going to pay off.” Top Tech Stories Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI showed off the updated Grok-3 model, showcasing a version of the chatbot technology that the billionaire has said is the “smartest AI on Earth.” Baidu Inc. reported a smaller-than-expected revenue drop, alleviating concerns its internet search and artificial intelligence businesses are buckling under fierce competition. Tesla Inc. is hiring in India, in mounting signs it plans to enter the market shortly after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk met Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US. President Xi Jinping’s embrace of Chinese tech bosses in a rare public meeting is fueling hope Beijing is shifting its stance to give the private sector a freer hand as it fights a trade war with Donald Trump.

            "full_text": "New data aggregation capability delivers needed storage cost savings and accelerates threat hunting and forensic investigations SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Corelight, the fastest growing provider of network detection and response (NDR) solutions, today announced a new capability to summarize network logs while retaining critical security insights. By introducing data aggregation for all Corelight sensors, customers have the ability to condense the volume of network data sent to security information and event management (SIEM) systems, accelerate threat hunting, and strengthen their overall security coverage. Corelight is the fastest growing provider of network detection and response (NDR) solutions. (PRNewsfoto/Corelight) Security operations center (SOC) teams are inundated with data, often spending a third of their workday (32%) investigating incidents that are not a real threat.[1] Managing this sheer volume of logs also places a heavy financial burden on organizations due to high storage processing and analysis costs. \"Corelight is committed to providing the most concise and actionable data for analysts without sacrificing the quality,\" said Vijit Nair, vice president of product, Corelight. \"This new aggregation capability condenses and prioritizes data before it reaches the SIEM, ensuring that only what is actionable and relevant is stored and ingested. This drastically decreases the amount of data sent to the SIEM, driving a more cost-effective approach to storing the data an organization needs.\" Because of the storage costs involved, most customers don't have the ability to send an unlimited amount of data to their SIEM. Forrester recently reported that reducing SIEM ingestion costs is one of the top inquiries analysts receive from clients.2 Reducing the volume of data to review improves threat detection accuracy for security analysts, resulting in faster investigation times and more efficient resource allocation. With this new offering, Corelight's Open NDR platform becomes the only NDR solution to provide data aggregation capabilities without impacting time intervals, granularity or sacrificing log integrity to reduce SIEM costs. Key features of the capability include: Operational efficiency: Enables cost-efficient log management with minimal impact on workflows, allowing SOC teams to focus on critical alerts and improving incident response times. Security visibility: Maintains key insights for incident response and detection, which is essential for identifying patterns and determining the impact of persistent threats over time. Flexible integration: Eliminates the need for additional pipeline tools and works seamlessly with existing SIEMs. Story Continues Customers now have the ability to reduce data volumes between 40% and 80% across the six most common log types – conn, dns, http, ssl, files and weird. Data aggregation can also reduce the time it takes to run a query by as much as 70%, which can boost detection accuracy. Additionally, by reducing data volume, customers can extend retention periods by up to 500%, enabling deeper forensic analysis and retroactive threat hunting for newly discovered indicators over a much longer timeframe.

About Corelight Corelight transforms network and cloud activity into evidence that security teams use to proactively hunt for threats, accelerate response to incidents, gain complete network visibility and create powerful analytics.

The company is benefiting from strong growth in Services revenues. It now has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, more than double what it had four years ago.The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple expects the March quarter's (second-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. For the Services segment, It expects a low double-digit growth rate.Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.

The company's Q4 earnings beat estimates while sales missed the same. Demand for Lilly's popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company's key top-line drivers.In the past two years, Lilly has received approvals for several new drugs like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca. Its new drugs contributed significantly to its top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer's.However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)Shares of Shopify have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+47.1% vs. +28%). The company is benefiting from strong growth in its merchant base. New merchant-friendly tools like Shopify Balance, Shopify Tax, Shopify Inbox and Tap to Pay solutions are helping it to win new merchants regularly.Strong adoption of these solutions holds promise for Shopify's prospects. Integration of Shop Pay Installments into the point-of-sale terminal and general availability of Pro makes it easier for merchants to discover and engage their customers. Expansion of back-office merchant solutions to more countries is also strengthening Shopify's international footprint.An expanding partner base that includes TikTok, Roblox, PayPal, Snap, Pinterest, Criteo, IBM, Cognizant, Amazon, and Adayen are expected to expand its merchant base further.

This microcap company with market capitalization of $44.56 million reports 11% year-over-year sales growth in third-quarter 2024, driven by its market-leading First Defense line targeting the $75-million scours prevention market.Capacity expansions support more than $30 million in annual sales, while Re-Tain, nearing FDA approval, aims to disrupt the $2-billion subclinical mastitis market with treatment free of milk/meat restrictions. ATM (at-the-market) offerings increased cash reserves to $3.8 million, aiding growth initiatives. International expansion and market diversification bolster opportunities.However, Re-Tain's 20-year, $50-million regulatory delays strain resources, whereas a low gross margin, rising costs and Tri-Shield inefficiencies weigh on profitability. High customer concentration (77% revenues from two clients), shareholder dilution, and competition from giants like Zoetis and Merck pose ongoing risks.(You can read the full research report on ImmuCell here >>>) Story Continues Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

            "full_text": "Accelerating development of new tools in architecture, engineering and construction calls for a thoughtful approach to managing change, advise tech leaders at HFA Architecture + Engineering BENTONVILLE, Ark., Feb. 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- AEC firms can reap the full benefits of emerging technology tools by prioritizing the wants and needs of their own teams—not change for its own sake, advised IT and operations leaders at HFA Architecture + Engineering. \"Pain point discussions at conferences like Autodesk University and IBM TechXchange often end up focusing not so much on the flaws of this or that solution, but on how tough it can be to get people to actually use good products,\" write John Raines, Director of IT/Systems, and Brittany Pylant, Director of Operations, in an advisory column published February 12. They oversee HFA's tech-stack and change-management team. To get the most out of today's advanced collaboration, visualization, 3D scanning and data-integration tools, AEC firms \"need to take a conscious, people-first approach to change-management,\" the technologists maintain. And there is no need to race ahead on technology out of fear of falling behind: \"Being realistic and grounded is not the same as stubbornly clinging to the status quo. To find the pace that works for your company, look at your specific goals and needs.\" To illustrate, Raines and Pylant contrast the needs of two hypothetical AEC firms—one that has hundreds of architects and engineers spread out all over the country and another with a small, locally based workforce. For the large firm, \"the perfect solution might be to have all users' PCs sit on virtually distributed servers, with remote access to powerful graphics processors,\" write Raines and Pylant. \"Without having to rely on their own machines, these architects and designers can collaborate from home while processing huge volumes of data in apps like Revit, Enscape and SketchUp.\" By contrast, the smaller A+E shop might have little need to \"virtualize\" in this way. \"Instead, software that drives project collaboration with third parties might be a more practical solution,\" the authors note. Adopting new workflows tends to require a lot of time and effort from employees, so taking a measured approach to the tech stack can translate into higher adoption by employees. \"Skeptics always wonder if higher-ups are rolling out a new platform just because it is a shiny object,\" write Raines and Pylant. \"When you can easily demonstrate that a new approach makes sense and will lead to greater productivity and creativity, people are much more willing to embrace it.\" Story Continues They encourage AEC firms to consider creating an internal change-management team charged with responsibilities such as: clearly communicating why the company is rolling out the new hardware or software solution providing frequent updates on implementation progress gathering and sharing success stories that illustrate the benefits of the new tool soliciting honest feedback The change-management team also could consider \"gamifying\" tech adoption as \"a fun way to get employees involved and set a positive tone.\" HFA, for one, recently launched an AI innovation competition designed to uncover new ways to improve efficiency and productivity. \"Staging innovation contests can create more 'power users' of high-priority technology tools,\" explain Raines and Pylant, and gamification \"can benefit AEC firms as their teams brainstorm to generate new data insights, catalyze collaboration, wow clients and claw back money and time.\" Lastly, they note that the need for conscious approaches to change-management in AEC is likely to grow due to the explosion of AI-powered solutions. Given all the sci-fi narratives and Silicon Valley hype, some employees \"might worry that their jobs will be replaced by a superintelligent overlord,\" joke Raines and Pylant. \"Reassuring messaging about the role of AI could be important as AEC firms roll out AI tools that do things like respond to detailed queries or cull through internal datasets to summarize complex information.\" And as AI continues to evolve, AEC firm will need to evaluate plenty of sales pitches from an explosion of new AI startups. \"An engaged, team-based approach can help them separate effective tools from the merely novel,\" conclude Raines and Pylant. \"Get your employees fired up by taking a people-first approach to managing change.\" The full article is available at:https://www.hfa-ae.com/blog/aec-tech-adoption Media Contacts: At Jaffe Communications, Elisa Krantz, (908) 789-0700, 390357@email4pr.com.
